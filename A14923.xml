            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Chriſtian, friendly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and loving country-man; about ten yeeres ſince paſt, at ſpare houres, as my daily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments would give me leave, I firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to collect and gather out of Scripture, and other godly and learned Authors, many prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and ſpeciall notes worthy obſervation and remembrance. When I firſt began, I had not thought to bring it forth to the worlds view, but onely for my owne private com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, to the comfort of my minde; the more I gathered, the more I was raviſhed, and being thus in holy contemplation, the matter being holy, excellent and heavenly, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, and ſtirred up by godly motion, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a worke ſo excellent, which through want of learning, I knew my ſelfe altogether
<pb facs="tcp:20262:6"/> unable to performe what my heart deſired; yet yeelding obedience to the holy motion, and humbly craving, and earneſtly praying the power divine to aſsiſt mee with his holy Spirit, to accompliſh that which I had a deſire to finiſh,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.13.</note> and had already begun; knowing, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>I am able to doe all things,</hi>

               <hi>through the helpe of him that ſtrengtheneth mee.</hi> And praying for his bleſsing, to bleſſe my endeavours, and then in the name of God,<note place="margin">Prov. 16.3,</note> with cheerfulneſſe of heart, I perſevered in my purpoſe, committing the ſucceſſe unto him,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8.</note> in whoſe power it is to bleſſe with his grace; whatſoever buſineſſe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to his glory: For fithence <hi>Salomon</hi> himſelfe ſaith, that mans wiſdome is unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and his knowledge in each Science un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, therefore I being utterly deſtitute of that wiſdome, and but of ſlender knowledge, neither may,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.5. 2 Cor. 4.5.</note> doe, nor will I preſume to thinke that by any meanes I am able of my ſelfe, to perform my deſired enterprize, as of my ſelfe, or bring to perfection ſo waighty a matter, and ſo intricate:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.4.</note> For though I may ſay with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> I know not what I have miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,

Againe, it is poſſible that ſome things which be not once touched by any one of my Authors, may be found expreſly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted down by me: &amp;, that matter by them handled in their workes is ſomewhat intricate, and not in the weake capacity of ſimple people to comprehend, for whoſe Chriſtian good theſe paines of mine were principally undertaken: which is by me in a briefe and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious manner expreſſed and ſet downe, that the weakeſt capacity may rightly underſtand the true ſence and meaning
<pb facs="tcp:20262:9"/> thereof, to the glory of God, and to the conſolation of their owne ſoule. Againe, many people that cannot ſpare much money, to buy many bookes of great volumes of ſundry Writers, may ſpare a little to buy this little tractate, wherein is compriſed the ſubſtance of their works tending to my purpoſe, ſufficient to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; wherein thou mayſt behold the back-parts of God thy maker and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and ſee the glory of Chriſt thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and mediatour,<note place="margin">Pſal. 34.8.</note> and taſte of the ſweetneſſe and conſolation of God the holy Ghoſt, thy Comforter and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, with the duties of Chriſtianity and Humanity, civill and morall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with many ſingular and excellent things of ſpeciall note, worthy remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.

                  <hi>Divers and many waies hath God ſpoken to our fathers by the Prophets;</hi> but laſt of all, hee hath ſpoken unto us by his Sonne: this is a ſpeciall way: for it happened not ſo to every Nation; as it did by a ſpeciall grace happen to the Iſraelites:<note place="margin">Pſal. 147.</note>

               <p>The third way is by inſpiration,<note place="margin">God is opened to the Elect by inſpiring.</note> and the ſecret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the holy Spirit, and this is called moſt ſpeciall for a difference from the other two, that be indifferent to good and evill; and this may pertaine to the elect onely, who beſide the light of workes, and the declaration by word, getteth almoſt certaine knowledge of God, yet rather a feeling, and a taſte of him,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.5.</note> by the lively and effectuall inſpiration and revelation of the holy Spirit of God; by theſe three waies man may certainly know there is a God.</p>

In the God-head there are three divine perſons, the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt; theſe three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are not three ſeverall ſubſtances, but three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſubſiſtences, or three divers manner of beings; of one and the ſame ſubſtance and divine eſſence; ſo that a perſon in the God-head, is an individuall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and incommunicable ſubſiſtence, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute of it ſelfe, and not ſuſtained by any other.</p>
                  <p>The perſons in this Myſterie, or divine Eſſence, are but three: there is another, and another; but not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, and another thing: the divine Eſſence in it ſelfe is neither divided nor diſtinguiſhed; but the three perſons in the divine Eſſence are diſtinguiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves by their names,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.27. Mat. 3.17. Eſay 63.16. Eph. 3.16, 17.</note> by their order, and by their actions: in this manner: the firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the glorious Trinitie, is named the Father, firſt in reſpect of his naturall ſonne Chriſt: ſecondly, in reſpect of the elect; his adopted ſonnes, not by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by grace: Chriſt the ſonne is the ſecond perſon of the glorious Trinitie; and the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſonne of his Father, not by grace, but by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;<note place="margin">Hebr. 1.3.

                  <p>Hence it is, that for as much as the Father is the fountaine &amp; originall of the Trinitie, the beginning of all eternall working; the name of God in relation, and the title of Creator in the Creed,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.1.</note> are given in eſpeciall manner to the Father, our Redemption to the Sonne,

                  </p>
                  <p>This divine order excepted, there is neither firſt nor laſt, neither ſuperioritie, nor inferioritie among the three perſons: for nature, they are coeſſentiall:<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.1.</note> for definitie, coequall: and for time, coeternall: For the eſſence doth not beget an eſſence, but the perſon of the Father, begetteth the perſon of the Sonne,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.19.</note> and ſo hee is God of God, and hath from his Father the beginning of his perſon and order,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.9.</note> but not of eſſence and time: And the holy Ghoſt proceedeth equally from both the Father and the Sonne, by an eternall and incomprehenſible ſpiration: for, as the Sonne receiveth the whole divine eſſence by generation; ſo the holy Ghoſt receiveth it wholly by ſpiration:<note place="margin">Rom. 11.36.</note> But becauſe the Father created,<note place="margin">As Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Act. 20.28. and Sanctification.</note> and ſtill governeth the world by the Sonne, in the holy Ghoſt; therefore theſe externall actions are indifferently, in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture often times aſcribed to each of the three perſons; and therefore are called Communicable and divided actions;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.23.</note> ſo that when wee ſay that the divine eſſence is in the Father unbegotten, in the Sonne begotten, and in the holy Ghoſt proceeding, we make not three eſſences, but onely ſhew the divers manner of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting; by which the ſame moſt ſimple, eternall and unbegotten eſſence ſubſiſteth in each perſon, namely, that it is not in the Father by generation, that is in the Sonne communicated from the Father by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and in the holy Ghoſt communicated from both the Father and the Sonne, by proceeding. Theſe are incommunicable, and doe make not an eſſentiall, accidentall or rationall, but a reall diſtinction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the three perſons: And becauſe the divine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence common to all the three perſons, is but one; we call the ſame Unitie: But becauſe there be three diſtinct perſons in this one indiviſible eſſence, we call

                  <p>The fourth is God, 600. times uſed in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, which ſignifieth, To burne or kindle; for God is light, and the Authour both of heate, light, and life, in all Creatures: either immediately of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or mediately by ſecondary cauſes; but when it is properly and abſolutely uſed,<note place="margin">Note.</note> it ſignifieth the eternall eſſence of God, being above all things, and through all things, and ſeeth all things in all places; giving life and light to all creatures, and preſerving and governing them in their wonderfull frame and order: therefore let us take heed every where what wee doe in his ſight: thus farre of the names which ſignifie the Eſſence of God.</p>
                  <p>The Name chiefely which ſignifieth the perſons in the Eſſence, is <hi>Elohim.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Elohim</hi> ſignifieth the mighty Judges;<note place="margin">Geneſ. 3.22. Deut. 7.6.</note> it is a name

                  </p>
                  <p>Now follow the names which ſignifie Gods eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall workes, which are theſe five eſpecially:</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 27.46. Math. 25.31. 2 Chro. 32.8.</note>The firſt, <hi>El:</hi> which is as much, as ſtrong God, and teacheth us that God is not onely moſt ſtrong, and fortitude it ſelfe, in his owne Eſſence: but alſo that it is hee that giveth ſtrength and power to all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: therefore Chriſt is called <hi>El Gibbor,</hi> the ſtrong, moſt mighty God: therefore let not Gods children feare the power of enemies, for <hi>El,</hi> our God, is more ſtrong then they.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Shaddai,</hi> that is, omnipotent: by this name God uſually ſtiled himſelfe to the Patriarchs; I am <hi>El Shaddai,</hi> the ſtrong God Almighty; becauſe hee is perfectly able to defend his ſervants from all evill, to bleſſe them with all ſpirituall and temporall bleſſings, and to performe all the promiſes which he hath made unto them for this life, and in the life to come. This Name belongeth onely to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to no creature, no not to the humanity of Chriſt. This may teach us with the Patriarchs, to put our whole confidence in God, and not to doubt of the truth of his promiſes and the performance thereof.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Adonai,</hi> which is, My Lord: this name Analogically is given to creatures, but properly it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20262:21"/> belongeth to God alone; it notes unto us the myſterie of the holy Trinitie: if I be <hi>Adonim,</hi> Lord,<note place="margin">Malac. 1.6.</note> where is my feare? this name is given to Chriſt, when he ſaith, <hi>Cauſe thy face to ſhine upon thy Sanctuary that is deſolate,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 9.17, 18.</note> 
                     <hi>for Adonia, the Lord Chriſt his ſake.</hi> The hearing of this holy name, may teach every man to obey Gods Commandements, and to feare him alone, to ſuffer none beſides him to raigne in his conſcience, to lay hold by a particular hand of faith upon his Word and Promiſes, and to challenge God in Chriſt to be his God, ſaying with <hi>Thomas, Thou art my Lord, and my God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Helion,</hi> that is moſt high; this name <hi>Gabriel</hi> giveth unto God, telling the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 9.2. Dan. 4.17.24.25. Act. 7.48. Luk. 1.32.</note> that the childe that ſhould be borne of her, ſhould be the Son of the moſt high. This teacheth us, that God in his Eſſence and Glory exceedeth infinitely all creatures of heaven and earth, and that no man ſhould be proud of any earthly honour or greatneſſe, but to deſire true dignitie, and to labour to have communion with God in grace and glory.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Abba,</hi> ſignifying Father;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.15. Eſay 9.5. Jam. 1.17. 2 Tim. 6.16.</note> for God is Chriſts father by nature, and Chriſtians by adoption and grace: Chriſt is called the everlaſting Father, the prince of Peace, becauſe he doth regenerate us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the new Teſtament: God is alſo called father of Light, becauſe God dwelleth in inacceſſible light, and is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

The ardent deſire of knowing God, is the ſureſt teſtimony of our love to God, and of Gods favour to us.<note place="margin">Pſal. 91.14, 15, 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Becauſe hee hath ſet his love upon mee, therefore will I deliver him: I will ſet him on high, becauſe he hath knowne my name; he ſhall call upon me, and I will heare him, yea, I will be with him in trouble, and deliver him, and bring him to honour, and ſhew him my ſalvation.</hi> Thus farre of the nominall Attributes:</p>
                  <p>The reall Attributes are of two ſorts, either abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute or relative: the abſolute Attributes cannot in any ſort agree to any creature, but to God alone; theſe are two, Simpleneſſe, and Infiniteneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Simpleneſſe is that whereby God is voide of all compoſition, diviſion, multiplication, accidents or parts compounding, either ſenſible or intelligible; ſo that whatſoever hee is, he is the ſame eſſentially: it hinders not Gods ſimpleneſſe that hee is three, becauſe God is three, not by compoſition of parts, but by co-exiſtence of perſons.<note place="margin">Job 11.8.</note> Infiniteneſſe is that whereby all things in God are void of all meaſure, limitation and bounds, above and beneath, before and after.

All the Attributes of God belong to every of the three Perſons, as well as to the Eſſence it ſelfe; with the limitation of a perſonall propriety: as, the mercy of the Father, is mercy begetting; the mercy of the Sonne, is mercy begotten; the mercy of the holy Ghoſt, is mercy proceeding. Againe, the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall Attributes of God differ not from his Eſſence, becauſe they are ſo in the Eſſence, that they are the very Eſſence it ſelfe; therefore in God there is nothing to bee found, which is not either his Eſſence or Perſon: to ſpeake properly, there are not in God many Attributes, but one onely which is nothing elſe but the divine Eſſence it ſelfe: but in reſpect of our reaſon, they are ſaid to be many different Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes; for our underſtanding conceives by the name of mercy, a thing differing from that which is called Juſtice: Gods eſſentiall Attributes are not therefore really inſeparable, for the Eſſentiall Attributes of God are not parts or qualities of the divine Eſſence, nor accidents in the Eſſence, as in a ſubject; but the very whole and intire Eſſence of God: ſo that ſuch Attribute is not an other, and another thing, but one and the ſame thing.

                     <hi>God worketh all in all;</hi> for all things be not onely of him, and by him, but in him, &amp; through him alſo; he is therefore generally preſent every where, and in all, and ſo preſerveth, directeth, &amp; governeth all things, but eſpecially touching his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall majeſtie and glory, hee is, and dwelleth in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20262:26"/> but by his goodneſſe and grace, he is, dwelleth and abideth in his elect and faithfull people on earth; ſuch as doe love and obey him, whom he doth eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally love, preſerve, defend, and keepe; which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the preſence of his grace. Therefore what ſurer ſafeguard can there be unto man, ſubject to ſo many dangers, afflictions, miſeries, and calamities, than to have his God preſent with him by a certaine ſpeciall grace and favour, but in the wicked and the ungodly, he is in them in his anger and wrath,<note place="margin">Pſal. 78.31, &amp;c.</note> whom hee doth abhorre as reprobate and caſt off.

Againe, God is preſent every where in his might, power and working: For, as an earthly king is roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent in every place of his kingdome and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, by his Officers, Magiſtrates and Miniſters,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20262:27"/> though not in his corporall preſence, and this kinde of preſence is more fit and convenient for the majeſtie of a king,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 17.</note> then if hee were every where preſent in his perſon; ſo it is with God, for though he is, and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in heaven principally in his majeſtie and glorie,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.6.</note> yet by his might,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.6.</note> power and working, he is every where preſent on earth, and worketh all in all, and through all; for it is not in mans power to order his own waies, or to rule and governe himſelfe,<note place="margin">Jerem. 10.23.</note> his ſteps and goings.</p>
                  <p>It is not here meant, nor determined, that the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of Gods nature be that wherein conſiſteth the habite, diſpoſition, naturall power, or lacke of power, affection,<note place="margin">God is three waies to be conſidered and diſtinguiſhed, that is to ſay, of what quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he is in his Eſſence, what in Perſon, and what in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> forme, faſhion, and the like, which the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians conſider in qualitie, but the ſame which hath his greateſt propertie to diſtinct the nature of God, which diſtinction is made from all others which be made of him, according to the which, God is of that qualitie as agreeth onely to himſelfe, which paſſeth all things elſe, not onely in excellencie, worthineſſe, and majeſtie, but alſo that by his wiſedome, might, power, and great goodneſſe, hee maketh, governeth, preſerveth and nouriſheth all things; for looke of what qualitie the works of God and the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doe ſet forth and declare him to be, of ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie wee may well ſay is his nature, for hee is ſuch in the qualitie of his nature, as hee is tried and found to be in his working.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8.17.</note> It is neither neceſſarie or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to finde and ſearch out exactly the qualitie of his majeſtie and worthineſſe,<note place="margin">Job 11.7, 8.</note> much leſſe of his Eſſence, but it is ſufficient for the godly man to adore the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his Eſſence, and the exceeding and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible highneſſe of his Majeſtie and worthineſſe in ſpirit,<note place="margin">Wiſd. 12.</note> and to ſeeke the qualitie of his nature in his workes, and in the holy Scriptures, and ſo content himſelfe with the teſtimonie of them both. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and therein, let him learne, underſtand and know,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20262:27"/> that the nature of God in it ſelfe, is to it ſelfe all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in all points, and that it is everlaſting, infinite, unſearchable, incomprehenſible, and Almightie, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe things which hee hath made,<note place="margin">Jer. 32.20, 21.</note> and that hee hath might, power and authoritie over all things, and ruleth, preſerveth and governeth all things that be in heaven, earth and waters; and that hee is good, favourable and loving towards men, gentle,<note place="margin">Wiſd. 11.</note> and mercifull, fore-ſeeing, and fore-knowing all things, preſent every where, ſlow unto anger, true, wiſe, juſt, judging every man rightly, according to their deſerts, which is reported and ſet forth of him in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and thereby wee may be aſſured of what qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie Gods nature is.

                     <hi>The heart of man is overthwart, and who ſhall know it?</hi> but there cannot be ſuch a perverſity and diſſimulation, aſcribed unto God: but when he worketh, hee declareth the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his nature in his working; ſo that his workes may be moſt aſſured teſtimonies by which the hearts of the faithfull may bee perſwaded of his goodneſſe and will:<note place="margin">Eſay 28.</note> and although he ſeeme ſometimes to worke contrary to his cuſtome, yet that is done to the intent that it ſhall come to that end which hee hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This is to worke truly and verily according to the quality of his nature, and to declare openly to the world, the teſtimony of his good will or anger, by word and deed.</p>
                  <p>Now there are five kinds of working. One is,<note place="margin">Five kinds of working.</note> when things bee wrought according to the ſtrength of their nature, without any governance of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or will; as in the working of fire, water, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinall hearbes, precious ſtones, and ſuch other things, whoſe working, if it bee guided by any reaſon or will, it is not their owne; but by ſome outward, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Gods or mans directions.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond kind, is of thoſe things which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the drift of nature in their working, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their owne will: though the maſtery of reaſon be lacking in them; yet ſuch is their working, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is forced againſt their will: and ſo worke the bruit beaſts.</p>
                  <p>The third kind, is of men which doe alſo worke according to the quality of their nature, and joyne theirs unto the governance of reaſon or will, but wrong and corrupt: and alſo ſubject and under a greater power: either of man, either of God, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20262:29"/> under this is alſo compriſed the working of evill ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is of good Spirits, which wee call An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: they worke alſo according to their nature, and that with underſtanding and will, but without any depravation thereof: wherein they differ from men, and from evill ſpirits, but they are alſo ſubject to a ſuperiour power, by whom their doings be directed.</p>
                  <p>The fift and laſt kind of working, is alſo according to the nature of the worker,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 42.15. &amp;c. &amp; 43.</note> with underſtanding and will, and that pure and uncorrupt, and is not ſubject unto the wiſdome or will of any ſuperiour, but is moſt free, wiſe, mighty, good, and infinite; upon whom all other things dependeth. This is the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of one very God; the beginning, increaſe, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, repairing, the rule and end of all things: moſt good, moſt free, willing, infinite, everlaſting, perfect, needing no other helpe,<note place="margin">No man is able ſufficiently to praiſe God; for he farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all praiſe</note> neceſſary and profitable: not to the worker, but to the workes, whoſe incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible waies, infinite multitude and unſearchable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration no man may ſeeke to know; whoſe infinite Goodneſſe, Wiſedome, Power, Majeſty and Glory, all Angels and men muſt have in admiration and worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Though the Multitude, Variety, Majeſty, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of the Workes of God be infinite and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, that neither the reaſon, nor number of them can bee comprehended by any mans imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or induſtry,<note place="margin">Eccle. 8.17.</note> even as <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> ſaid. Yet among all the Workes of God,<note place="margin">Among Gods workes, the worke of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is firſt.</note> wee ought firſt to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the workes of the Creation: and herein wee muſt leave the conſideration of thoſe workes that are of the Father towards the Sonne, and of the Sonne towards the Father, and of both of them toward the holy Spirit, and of the holy Spirit toward both of them, which are unſearchable and not neceſſary to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20262:29"/> know, nor belonging to Creation. But it is even e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if the creature doe acknowledge, honour and glorifie the workes of his Creator, in that, that he is the Creator, Encreaſer, Conſerver, Repairer, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Perfecter of all: when we ſay, the Father created all things, the Word muſt not bee excluded, neither the holy Spirit; becauſe that by the Word, and with the Spirit, all things were made and created. When we ſay, the ſunne nouriſheth and giveth light unto the earth, wee exclude not his heate, nor his brightneſſe, without which he doth not accompliſh his worke. Againe, when we ſay, all things are created of God; we muſt not include thoſe things that be evill, in reſpect they be evill; for they be not of God,<note place="margin">Iohn 8.44.</note> but of ſatan, the father of all evill: this is the plaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of our true and onely God, from all falſe gods and idols.</p>
                  <p>To poſſeſſe our hearts, with greater awe of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, whileſt we admire him for his ſimpleneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitneſſe, adore him for his unmeaſurableneſſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſſe and eternity: ſeeke wiſdome from his underſtanding and knowledge, ſubmit our ſelves to his bleſſed will and pleaſure; love him for his love, mercy, goodneſſe, and patience, truſt to his word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his truth; feare him for his power, juſtice, and anger; reverence him for his holineſſe; and praiſe him for his bleſſedneſſe; and to depend all our life on his faithfull promiſes, who is the onely Authour of our life, being, and all the good things we have.<note place="margin">Eph. 5.</note> Let us therefore ſtirre up our ſelves to imitate the divine Spirit in his holy Attributes; and to beare, in ſome meaſure, the Image of his wiſdome, love, goodneſſe, juſtice, mercy, truth, patience, zeale, and anger againſt ſinne; and ſtrive that wee may bee wiſe, loving, juſt, mercifull, true, patient, and zealous, as our God is; and that wee may in our prayers and meditations,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:20262:30"/> conceive aright of his divine Majeſty, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thoſe groſſe and blaſphemous imaginations, which naturally ariſe in mens braines:<note place="margin">Pſal. 90.2. Rom. 1 23, &amp;c.</note> as when they conceive God to be like an old man ſitting in a chaire, and the bleſſed Trinity to be like that tripartite idoll, which Papiſts ſet up in their Church windowes. When therefore thou art to pray unto God, let thy heart ſpeake unto him,<note place="margin">Pſal. 90.2. 1 King. 8.27. 1 Iohn 5.7.</note> as unto that Eternall, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, Almighty, Holy, Wiſe, Juſt, Mercifull Spirit, and moſt perfect and individuall Eſſence of three ſeverall ſubſtances, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt; who being preſent in all places, ruleth Heaven and Earth, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth all mens hearts, knoweth all mens miſeries, and is onely able to beſtow on us all graces which we want; and to deliver all penitent ſinners, that with faithfull hearts ſeeke for Chriſts ſake his helpe, out of all their afflictions and troubles whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>If therefore thou doſt believe that God is Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, why doſt thou feare devils or enemies? Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently truſt in God, and crave his helpe in all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and dangers; if thou believeſt that God is infinite, how dareſt thou provoke him to anger?

If thou believeſt that God is the Soveraigne good, why is not thy heart more ſetled upon him then on al worldly goods? If thou doſt indeed believe that God is a juſt Judge, how dareſt thou live ſo ſecurely in ſinne without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? If thou doſt truely believe that God is moſt wiſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> why doſt thou not referre the events of croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and diſgraces unto him, who knoweth how to turne all things to the beſt, unto them that love him? If thou art perſwaded that God is true, why doſt thou doubt of his promiſes? and if thou believeſt that God is beauty, and perfection it ſelfe, why doſt thou not make him the chiefe end of all thy deſires and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;

                     <p>VVHen firſt I began to underſtand of God, I had this imagination, that God was a generall power, within whoſe circle all things are, without whom nothing, by whom all things were made, and to whom all men ow their ſervice. This learning was taught mee by the wiſdome of my naturall ſoule, and by the common example of Chriſtians; for all men acknowledge a God, and all Chriſtians their duties; this is the common knowledge of men, but not the profitable, more commendable in Philoſophers than Chriſtians, being without uſe, without application; I have therefore better endevoured my ſelfe, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to know God, my God, to know him in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, in the trinity of perſons, and in their offices; for thus to know, and then to apprehend and apply, is ſalvation.

The Trinity is the diſtinction of perſons, without denying the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or nature of God, the Father, Sonne and holy Ghoſt; though they be three diſtinct in name, they are one in power, without diviſion, without inequality; the Sonne begotten as ancient as the Father, the Holy Ghoſt prooceeding from them both, is equall with them both; no priority in their Omnipotency, but all of them being alike able in all things, and alwaies

                     <p>It is further neceſſary to know the Trinity in their ſeverall offices; for though the God-head be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided: as that no one perſon in the Trinity doth worke without cooperation, the Father, Son,<note place="margin">Severall offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</note> and the Holy Ghoſt, conſpiring in every act of every ſeverall perſon, yet in the wiſedome of their owne decree, they have determined to the ſeverall perſons of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſeverall executions of offices, wherein the whole Trinity conſpire, yet ſome one perſon in the Trinity hath the name of principall; therefore wee ſay, God the Father made the world, God the Sonne redeemed it, God the Holy Ghoſt doth governe it.

                     <p>When I had thus conſidered the nature of God,

                     <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſervant and witneſſe of God Almighty, being inſpired by the holy Ghoſt, hath left recorded to all poſterities the manner of the Creation of the World,<note place="margin">The ſcripture is onely able to ſatisfie all doubts.</note> to which authority, not onely my ſelfe, but every faithfull Chriſtian doth confidently adhere, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſclaiming all contradiction, all diverſity of opinion.</p>
                  <p>In the Creation is principally conſidered, the Creator God; and the creatures the workes of Gods Creation. In the Creator is conſidered, his power, his purpoſe: his power, in being able by his word to finiſh ſuch a worke of admiration: his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,<note place="margin">The world was made for man, and man for God.</note> not that hee needed any ſuch thing that he had made, to ſupply any defect in his Divinity; but for the uſe of a creature, man, which afterward he was to make; to whom hee gave the Heavens, the earth, and all the hoſt of them for the ſervice of man; reſerving onely man for the ſervice of himſelfe. In the creatures is conſidered, their originall or matter of their creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:<note place="margin">The matter of the creation.</note> for ſome things he made of nothing, ſome of fire, ſome of aire, ſome of earth, ſome of water, ſome of fleſh, of nothing he created the Heaven, the Earth, and the Sea, whereunto as is ſuppoſed, may be joyned the heavenly Spirits, but under correction of others; of earth hee made and ſhaped the firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: alſo of the earth hee made beaſts, and all kind of plants, and hearbs: of the aire hee made wind, and blaſts:<note place="margin">The order God obſerved.</note> of the waters he created fiſh, and foule; of fleſh he created <hi>Eve,</hi> the firſt mother of our kind. Next the order wherein they were created: this originall was nothing, for God created all things by the power of his Word, without matter; there being nothing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20262:34"/> whereof to make any thing: the order obſerved in the creation was, that God determined the World, and the workes therein for the ſervice of man, would, before he made man, ſtore the World, mans manſion-houſe, with very needfull providence; that man, at the very inſtant of his beginning, might know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be in the fulneſſe of Gods favour, nothing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting which might either adminiſter to him profit, pleaſure, or ſerve his neceſſity. Againe, in the creatures themſelves God obſerved a ſpeciall order: Firſt, hee created light, without which the workes of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe had not beene viſible. Secondly, he created Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, giving that priority,<note place="margin">Apoc. 4.11. Of the Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bodies.</note> for the excellency and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the place. Next he made a ſeparation of the Earth and Waters, and gave the Earth a generation of all Plants and Trees bearing good ſeed. Then hee placed in the Firmament the Planets, and fixed the Starres, and Celeſtiall bodies: the which ſerve not onely for light, to diſtinguiſh times and ſeaſons; but alſo by their influence, for the generation and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all living creatures. Then God furniſhed the two elements of Water and Ayre, with creatures of that kind. Laſt of all, hee ſtored the Earth with the creatures which live on that element; and when hee had finiſhed the creation of all things, hee then made man after his owne ſimilitude, and gave him the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the World, and the creatures hee had made; giving him intereſt in all, and power over all, without exception of any. This knowledge of the Creation is neceſſary in the underſtanding of every Chriſtian of carefull conſcience: with which knowledge the leſſe learned may ſatisfie themſelves, avoyding the curious ſearch of ſuch nice queſtions, as may diſtract the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and availe not unto ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>The knowledge of the power of God in creating the World doth admoniſh and remember all men, that

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20262:35"/> ſupply that purpoſe for which God created them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſeeing God created the world for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde in generall, it doth remember us, not to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate the Creatures of God to our owne private ends, but to communicate the uſe of them, with all ſuch as ſhall need them; for God gave not the world to <hi>Adam</hi> onely, but to his poſterity alſo; therefore every man is lawfully intereſted in the enjoying of Gods Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.

There is another, and that is remiſſeneſſe, when men acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no reverence, no reſpect to the dignity of holy Angels. The holy men in all ages, at the ſight of an Angell,<note place="margin">Gen 18.2, 3.</note> would uſe extraordinary reſpect of humility and reverence: as <hi>Abraham,</hi> hee bowed himſelfe to the ground, in reverence of an Angell, and called him Lord: ſo likewiſe, in the example of all the godly, though in theſe times the Angels doe not preſent themſelves, as in the old world, in viſible formes; therefore they neede no reverence, yet they are often preſent in their ſpirituall natures, which though wee cannot diſcerne them with our corporall eyes, yet a ſpirituall judgement by holy contemplation may diſcerne them with the eye of faith; for if there be a duty of reverence to men, with whom wee converſe, doubtleſſe there is a reverence alſo due to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels, which doe converſe, and are converſant with us.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine of the Creation, the Nature, the Power, and the Office of Angells, doth admoniſh and remember all men, to make theſe and ſuch like
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20262:40"/> profitable uſes, to put us in remembrance of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power of God, and that in a double reſpect: firſt, being able by the power of his Word, to create a Creature of ſuch excellence, and power of nature, in nature excellent, in number infinite. Secondly, being ſerved and attended by theſe infinit number of power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full creatures, one whereof is able, if God pleaſe to command, to deſtroy the world, and all the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on earth; God then being of ſuch infinite power in himſelfe, in his ſervants the Angels, it ought juſtly to move all men, to a reverence of ſo great a Majeſty, and feare to provoke a power ſo able and infinite. Againe, the apoſtacy of thoſe Angels that fell from their obedience and firſt ſtate of happineſſe, doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh all men, that ſeeing the Angels of ſuch power, of ſuch excellence, and ſo neere God in his favour and preſence, were tempted to fall from ſo great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. Let no man therefore be ſecure, or preſume in the confidence of his owne truſt, but daily beg and crave, wholly to relie upon the mercy and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, without whom there is no ſafety, no ſecurity, the greateſt power in the world being but weakneſſe without the ſtrength of his ſupportation: For,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.4, 5.6.</note> if God ſpared not the Angels that had ſinned, but caſt them downe to hell, and delivered them into chaines of darkeneſſe to be kept unto judgement, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpared he the old world,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 7.</note> but ſaved <hi>Noah</hi> the eight perſon, a preacher of righteouſneſſe, and his family,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 19.</note> and brought in the floud upon the world of the ungodly, and turned the Cities of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorah</hi> into aſhes, overthrew them, and damned them, and made them an enſample unto thoſe that after them ſhould live ungodly, neither will he ſpare the tranſgreſſion of men, that of knowledge and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe offend him; for the Angels are farre exceeding greater then men, both in power and might. If God
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20262:40"/> ſpared not the better, hee will not ſpare the worſe, but caſt them likewiſe into chaines of darkneſſe, to bee kept unto the judgement of condemnation. Againe, though the Angels were of this excellency and dignity of nature; and though many fell from their ſtate of innocency, as <hi>Adam</hi> afterward did, yet the Redeemer of the world, Chriſt Jeſus,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.16, 17, 18, &amp;c.</note> did not vouchſafe to take their nature and redeeme them, but left them in the judgement of condemnation; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking and finiſhing the worke of Redemption for man onely, and not for Angels: for as much as there was no recovery, no turning, no hope of ſalvation for theſe wicked and trayterous angels: there was alſo no cauſe why their ſinnes ſhould bee ſet forth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, as was the ſinne of man,<note place="margin">Verſ. 15.</note> which had not onely a puniſhment layd on him immediately, but alſo a promiſe made for his reliefe and remedy: in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Apoſtle ſaid, that Chriſt tooke not upon him the nature of Angels, but the ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> for he came not to ſave the angels that had falne, but men: yea rather to deſtroy the evill angels and their power; and therefore they cry,<note place="margin">Mark. 1.24.</note> 
                     <hi>What have we to doe with thee Jeſus of Nazareth, art thou come before the time, to deſtroy us?</hi> and that they ſhall never bee ſaved, it is plaine enough by the words of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Math. 25.41.</note> 
                     <hi>Goe yee curſed to the everlasting fire, which is prepared for the divell and his angels.</hi> Therefore this ought to provoke all men to a zealous affection of love towards God, who gave his onely beloved Sonne for the redemption of men; preferring them in his love, before the angels that had offended him: and, that Angels in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall natures are ſent to miniſter,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.14.</note> for their ſakes that ſhall be heires of ſalvation. It doth remember us firſt, the wonderfull love of God toward mankind, in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his choice ſervants the Angels that waite in his preſence, neere the perſon of his Majeſty; to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20262:41"/> about men in the ſervice of their ſalvation. Secondly, it ought to move men to a preciſe reverence in the common behaviour of their lives, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare not only the committing of groſſe and capitall ſins; but all unſeemlineſſe both of words and actions, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>For the reverence of Angels:</hi> for as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels are baniſhed and driven away from the poſſeſſed,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.10.</note> by prayer and holy exerciſe: ſo the good Angels then leave our company, when we delight in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and unſeemely behaviour: therefore conſider thou devour ſoule, how great the goodneſſe of God is toward thee,<note place="margin">Math. 1.</note> who hath made his Angels thy keepers; and hath ſent his owne Sonne to redeeme thee:<note place="margin">Note.</note> the Sonne of God is made fleſh to ſave us, the holy Ghoſt is ſent to ſanctifie us,<note place="margin">Acts 1.</note> the Angels are ſent to protect us. So then, all the Court of Heaven, doth as it were ſerve us, and convey their benefits unto us; therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that all inferior creatures were made for the uſe of man; ſeeing the Angels themſelves, creatures far more excellent, do not deny their miniſtry unto us; the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels themſelves are preſent with us, and do refreſh and eaſe us, when we are weary with the burthen and heat of temptations, and calamities: therefore, O moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull God, thou that leadeſt us through the deſart of this World; by the conduct of thy Angels grant that we may at length be carried by them into thy everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>This knowledge of the Mercy and Power of God in creating the Angels, and appointing them to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to all the children of grace, ſhall bind mee in the moſt aſſured bonds of duty and thankfull acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement to my God,<note place="margin">To repoſe in God, is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſafety.</note> I will alſo confidently repoſe in the truſt of Gods promiſes, being aſſured that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that his holy Spirit, that his holy Angels are my ſupporters: therefore I will never deſpairingly feare the power of adverſaries, evill men or divels, or what

                     <hi>Let us make man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our owne Image, according to our likeneſſe.</hi> Secondly,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20262:42"/> God made man of a preexiſtent matter, not creating him of nothing as hee did the other creatures,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.7.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord God made man of the duſt of the ground.</hi> Thirdly, God gave man the rule and government over all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, giving him liberty over all, to uſe them in their kind with moderation: <hi>and let them rule over the Fiſh of the Sea,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 1.26.</note> 
                     <hi>and over the Foules of the Ayre, and over the Beaſts of the Earth, and over every thing that creepeth and moveth on the earth.</hi> Fourthly, the end of mans crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was for the honour and glory of God that made him,<note place="margin">Eſay 43.7.</note> 
                     <hi>Every one ſhall be called after my Name, for I formed them, made them, and created them, for my owne glory.</hi> Though no man can bee able to give a reaſon of the ſecret will of God, yet this may bee imagined that ſeeing the world and all the creatures therein, ſave onely man, have a generall reſpect to the honour of God: therefore they were by the generall power of Gods divinity created, but man being determined in the counſell of God, that man ſhould bee an occaſion that the whole Trinity ſhould have divine exerciſe, in the government of his life, and every one in their ſeverall aſſignements,<note place="margin">A ſuppoſed reaſon of Gods ſecret will.</note> as ſhould pleaſe themſelves to appoint: therefore God in the Trinity of perſons made man; becauſe afterward in the Trinity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, hee was to governe him: God gave man a Law, which he being not able to keepe did condemne him: Chriſt the ſecond perſon, moderateth the Law, and giveth the Goſpell, promiſing Salvation to all them that will believe in him, the holy Ghoſt moveth in the hearts of Gods Elect, and giveth them grace to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend by faith, the meanes of their Salvation. Thus are they perſonally buſied in the government and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of man;<note place="margin">The holy Ghoſt moves grace.</note> thus were they perſonally at his Creation. The ſecond conſideration, is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mans creation, which in a double reſpect is conſiderable in the perſon of God. Firſt, when God
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20262:42"/> formed other creatures, hee required no matter, but gave them being by his Word, but when hee formed man, he firſt prepared his matter, then gave the forme,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and created man, wherein God doth uſe a double care, a double diligence; not that he could not create man of nothing, as hee had done the reſt of his Creatures, but he did it in the wiſdome of his divinity, for reſpect and cauſefull conſideration, for to expreſſe his double, or rather his manifold affections to the creature, man. Secondly, to prevent the proud imagination man might have of the nobleneſſe of his nature, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet in the pride of mans fleſh to boaſt his deſcent, and to derive his families from antiquity and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The third conſideration is, the diſtinguiſhing forme of man, his reaſonable ſoule, whereby God doth diſtinguiſh him from all the creatures on earth, giving him Reaſon and Diſcourſe to helpe him, for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of himſelfe, and the government of the world: this is alſo conſiderable in theſe reſpects: firſt the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God obſerved in the creation. God firſt made the world, afterward made man, and gave him the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion prepared for him. So when he made man,<note place="margin">Note.</note> he firſt framed the body, then formed the ſoule; for he made not the body and the ſoule at one inſtant, but in their times and order; for when he had made the houſe, he then put in the Tenent, and not before. Secondly is conſidered, the excellency of our ſoules; for God neither made nor created our ſoule, but inſpired it, by the vertue of his divinity,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 2.7.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord God made man of the duſt of the ground, and breathed into his noſtrills the breath of life, and man became a living ſoule.</hi> There was both the matter of his body, and the nature and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his ſoule, being the breath of Almighty God, divine, ſpirituall, and eternall; for before God inſpired the ſoule, man was onely framed, and not formed, his reaſonable ſoule being that which doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh

                     <hi>in the Image of God created he them, male and female;</hi> ſo he gave them the rule and government of the world, that is, the man and the woman: For as God did not divide them in their natures, neither would hee divide them in the uſe and government of his Creatures; but whatſoever is lawfull to the one, is lawfull to the other, both of them having equall and indifferent rule and power in the uſe of Gods Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Laſty is conſidered, the end of mans creation, which is, that God may be glorified and honoured in a double reſpect: firſt, in acknowledgement, when men have a thankfull remembrance of Gods mercy, in the creation, preſervation, and in the redemption of man-kind; this acknowledgement is declared in holy Meditations, Prayers, Thankeſgiving and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to the Name, the Memory, and the Majeſty of God: as <hi>Moſes</hi> acknowledging Gods mercy, in their deliverance out of Egypt, <hi>the Lord is my ſtrength and praiſe,</hi>

The conſideration of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whereby, though we underſtand not the cauſes of all his workes, yet wee may partly obſerve, what hee hath done for us, and make ſome difference of them, and withall, enter into contemplation of ſuch things, as wee may in ſome degree, with admiration conſider, and apply according to the meaſure of the gift of God.

                  <p>The generall uſe of this Doctrine, is a generall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of duties that all men owe to God their Creatour, who of his owne accord,<note place="margin">Man made noble out of baſeneſſe.</note> hath beene pleaſed to make man ſo noble a Creature of ſo baſe a

                  <p>This knowledge of our creation ſhould remember us in our dutifull obedience to God, that ſeeing his hand hath faſhioned us, and that his mercy hath made our bodie a Temple or Sanctuary for his holy Spirit to dwell in,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.17.</note> therefore let us carefully keepe the temple of our bodies from the filth of ſinne: and endeavour our ſelves in ſuch holy exerciſes, that our ſoules may have the perpetuall fellowſhip of the holy Ghoſt, without which there is no happineſſe nor ſalvation: let us therefore refraine to accompany with the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie of ſinne, leſt we runne into their danger in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing our bodies, the Temples of the holy Ghoſt with diſeaſed company, let us hate the imitation of mens vices: let us not bee tempted with their fellowſhip, becauſe we know that when we prophane our bodies the temples of the holy Ghoſt, wee ſhall baniſh that ſweet ſociety, fruſtrate our hope, and wound the quiet of our conſcience.

                  <p>This is the plaine and neceſſary knowledge of the fall of man from the ſtate of innocency. In which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument the overcurious wits of men have travelled in the ſearch of many intricate queſtions; I will therefore forbeare to relate the number of mens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.</p>
                  <p>The fall of man from the firſt ſtate of his innocency, doth remember all men what the miſerable condition of our nature is, what glory wee have loſt, and into what degree of adverſity we are falne: wee that were the moſt excellent of Gods creatures, are now the moſt miſerable; provoking, not onely God, to be our enemy,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.14.</note> but the creatures of God alſo, to hate and dread us. Becauſe for our diſobedience, God did curſe them, and that for our annoyance God did ſuffer the goodneſſe of their nature to be altered, in ſo much as that they which before ſinne entred our nature, were our ſervants, are now become our enemies; and wee that then were their Lords, and had power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them, are now in bondage of feare, and dread their power,<note place="margin">A miſerable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration.</note> for that ſupremacy, power and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which <hi>Adam</hi> had over all the world, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to us that are his poſterity. He had it, and loſt it by ſin, we ſhould have had it but are prevented by ſin, ſin being the cauſe both in him &amp; us, why we are degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from our dignity,<note place="margin">Ierem. 14.2.</note> and caſt into this contempt and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20262:50"/> diſgrace of fortune. Whenſoever therefore God ſhall pleaſe to puniſh any mans proſperity, and to tempt his patience with the burthen of adverſity, his care muſt be, to ſearch the cauſe of his affliction, and when he hath found the cauſe, to labour by all meanes to remove it: For diſeaſes are not cured before their cauſes be both knowne and removed. And as diſeaſes of the body are not ingendred without their corrupt cauſe, no more our ſpirituall afflictions are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted without their evill cauſe, which is ſinne, the originall and continuall cauſe of all our evill. Thus ought Chriſtians to judge of themſelves, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the miſeries of their life, to inquire at their own hearts, and to ſearch their own actions, and their owne tranſgreſſions; for there, and but there,<note place="margin">Note.</note> ſhall they finde the true cauſe of all their miſery, and not as doth the fooliſh and wicked, who when they have extraordinary diſcontents, or miſ-fortunes, blame their nativities,<note place="margin">Pſal. 34.</note> and ſearch the motions and conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, falls and exaltations of the ſtars and celeſtiall bodies; as if by their influence and conſtellation, their grievous alterations were occaſioned; ſuch fondneſſe is ridiculous, and to little purpoſe, and they are much deceived who ſeeke for that farre off, which is to be found onely at home, even in their hearts, in their ſinfull natures, and in their ſinfull actions. Againe, the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> from his innocency becauſe of ſinne, doth inſtruct every man in the knowledge of Gods divine nature; for God is ſo reſpectively holy, that hee will not entertaine familiarity and neereneſſe with any creature that hath the leaſt touch or ſpot of ſinne;<note place="margin">The nature of holineſſe.</note> therefore did hee baniſh the Angels out of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, though they offended, as ſome thinke, but in thought: <hi>Adam</hi> alſo, though it was his firſt ſinne, and not of his owne election, but doubly tempted by his wife and the divell,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 3.</note> yet could not the holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20262:51"/> of God indure him, but caſt him out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe into miſery and tribulation; therefore ought all men to make conſcience of all ſinne, and to feare the committing of the leaſt, becauſe there is no ſinne, be it never ſo little, that God will diſpenſe withall, but as himſelfe,<note place="margin">All ſinne is in Gods hatred.</note> ſo is his affection. Hee is holy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtaine, without imputation, and his favour is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them onely, that with all their power, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour themſelves in all the workes of his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>
                  <p>Now, if the over-ſpreading of ſinne, whereby this miſchiefe paſſed through, infected, corrupted, and made ſubject unto death all man-kind, we muſt harken unto the Apoſtle, who appointed this over-ſpreading, neither to the divell,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> neither to the woman, but unto <hi>Adam:</hi> For the divell did not convey over ſinne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Eve,</hi>

                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:20262:51"/> his firſt begotten ſonne: alſo the miſery, corruption and decay which followed the fall of our firſt parents, and invaded all man-kinde, doth ſet forth the power and vertue of Gods providence, to be much greater unto us: for that we are repaired and renovated by Chriſt after our fall, to a farre more bleſſed eſtate then we were created in before wee fell,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.53.</note> like as in the day of reſurrection, when wee ſhall be all raiſed up out of the duſt of the earth, and the corruptible put on incorruptible, and the mortall put on immortality, and the vertue of the power of God ſhall be declared much better than if we had ſtill lived and continued in this life without corruption and death. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereas by the ſinne committed, man-kind pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and fell into ſo great corruption,<note place="margin">It was not Gods fault that man ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and loſt his innocency.</note> depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and death, it is not ſuch, that it ought to be imputed unto God, but rather ſuch as the juſtice of God may appeare therein; therefore it was meet and needfull, that Chriſt ſhould not be conceived and borne in the wombe of the Virgin, of the ſeed of man, leſt he ſhould be borne partaker of ſin, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the working of the Holy Ghoſt. Laſtly, ſeeing the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> by the intiſement of the woman, did ſo deface the excellence and innocence of our nature, as that the corruption thereof did deſcend from him to all poſterities, this ought to abate the pride of man, that no man dignifie or exalt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the pride of his nature; for all men are of one and the ſame nature, and all men in one and the ſame condemnation, there being no power in mans nature to raiſe himſelfe to the dignity of Gods favour, that being onely in the power of him that firſt created us holy and innocent, who againe will reſtore us, if we faithfully ſpend our indeavours in holy actions. Againe, it ought to move all men to beare indifferent favour to all the children of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:20262:52"/> God, and not to deſpiſe any, either for the defect of nature or fortun, but to pitty and commiſerate the common calamities, becauſe there is no judgement or puniſhment inflicted upon any man,<note place="margin">How to judge calamities.</note> but it is generally cauſed by all men: all men having offended God with <hi>Adam,</hi> and all men for that ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> being ſubject to all miſery: for thoſe calamities and greater, are due to us, though other men indure them; and thoſe benefits which ſome injoy,<note place="margin">Gods favour is not by deſert, but by bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence.</note> and others want, they have them not of deſert, but of benevolence from the favour of God, who giveth them according to the pleaſure of his will, without reſpect of perſons.</p>
                  <p>Seeing that <hi>Adam,</hi> who had ſuch extraordinary indowments of grace, and whoſe nature God had ſo adorned with excellence, that hee delighted in his company; and ſeeing he was innocent, and his nature unſtained with corruption or infirmity,<note place="margin">We farre more eaſie to be tempted then <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </note> did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, run in contempt of Gods Commandement, and thereby did purchaſe Gods indignation: Let us therefore be extraordinary carefull to withſtand all provocations that may tempt us to any ſinne; for our nature is much more eaſie to be tempted than <hi>Adams</hi> was, his being innocent and holy, ours in corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtained, he having power in himſelfe to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his tempter, we having no power in our nature to reſiſt, but rather an appetite and affectation to evill, naturally inclined to neglect that grace, which ſhould make us able to reſiſt temptation, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the aſſaults of the divell,<note place="margin">The depraved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> and becauſe our nature is thus depraved, and that our owne blind directions would but leade us to condemnation; let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with humble confidence implore the favour of God,<note place="margin">How to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the power of temptation.</note> that by his ſpirit hee would give us directions, and that by his mighty hand hee may ſupport us againſt the power of all temptations; for we know our ſtrength is but weakneſſe, and if God take his

Thus let us pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe againſt our ſpirituall tempters, and thus we ſhall prevaile.</p>
                  <p>Againe, ſeeing God hath not ſpared <hi>Adam,</hi> nor the Angels that ſinned, who in their natures were much more excellent then we, but for their ſinne, gave them over to condemnation:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.4.</note> how much leſſe will he ſpare us if wee continue in the committing of ſinne, and not endeavour our ſelves with all diligence in godly exerciſe?

Let us therefore flie all ſinne,<note place="margin">The wages of ſin in death.</note> as we would death, becauſe the earneſt of ſinne is certainely rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with death; ſinne and death being inſeparable in fellowſhip: for the ſoule that ſinneth muſt die the death, and no ſoule dieth but the ſinfull.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> was, that men might rightly underſtand themſelves, and thereby know in what degree of holineſſe they were; becauſe that men are often partiall in their owne judgement, and willingly blinde themſelves in the view of their owne calamities; wherefore then ſerveth the Law,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.19.</note> it was added becauſe of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, that by the Law men might know where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have tranſgreſſed.</p>
                  <p>A third reaſon of the ordination of the Law, is, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Laſtly, the Law was given for the glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God, that all the world might judge of his infinite mercy to mankind. In this reſpect, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all men are judged and condemned by the law of nature, and by the Law of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; yet in the greatneſſe of his love, hee is content to forgive the treſpaſſe, and the judgement therefore due unto mankind,<note place="margin">Gods admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mercy.</note> and finally, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine theſe tranſgreſſors his enemies, into the boſome of his mercy, giving them Mercy in ſtead of Juſtice, and eternall life,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.20,</note> when they deſerved death and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.<note place="margin">21.</note> Moreover, the Law entered thereupon, that the offence ſhould abound; nevertheleſſe, <hi>Where Sinne abounded, there Grace abounded much more, that as Sinne had raigned unto death, ſo might Grace alſo raigne by righteouſneſſe unto eternall life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> and this is an admirable degree of love in God, that he will decline, or lay by his Majeſty, and to miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, wretched, nay, ſinfull creatures exerciſe his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in reſtoring and advancing us, that have ſo highly offended his Majeſty, and abounded in tranſgreſſions; for theſe cauſes was the Law given and delivered to man;<note place="margin">Deut. 27.26.

Where are now thy big and daring words, now in my greateſt need, canſt thou ſpeake nothing in my defence? Canſt thou neither daunt theſe enemies with threatning words, nor intreat them with faire ſpeeches? Alaſſe, the tongue two daies agoe lay ſpeechleſſe, that it cannot in his greateſt extremity either call for a little drinke, or deſire a friend to take away with his finger the flegme that is ready to choak him.

Oh! how ſuddenly death hath ſtolne upon me, with unſenſible degrees, like the Sunne which man perceives not to move, and yet is moſt ſwift of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? How doth death wreake on me his ſpite, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pity? What joy remaines now of all my former fleſhly pleaſures, wherein I placed my chiefeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights? thoſe fooliſh pleaſures were but deceitfull dreames, and now they are all paſt like vaniſhing ſhadowes: but to thinke of thoſe eternall paines, which I muſt endure for thoſe ſhort pleaſures, paines me as hell before I enter into hell: yet juſtly I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, as I have deſerved I am ſerved; that being made after Gods Image, a reaſonable ſoule, able to judge my owne eſtate; and having mercy ſo often offered, and I intreated to receive it; I ſo wilfully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Gods grace, and preferred the pleaſures of ſinne, before the religious care of pleaſing God, leudly ſpending my ſhort time without conſidering what account I ſhould make at the laſt day: and now all the pleaſures of my life put together, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervaile not the leaſt part of my preſent paines: my joyes were but momentary, and gone before I could ſcarce enjoy them; but my miſeries are eternall and never ſhall have end.

Curſed be the day that I was firſt united to ſo leud a body: oh, that I had but ſo much favour as that I might never ſee thee more! our parting is bitter and dolefull, but our meeting againe to receive at that dreadfull day, the fulneſſe of our deſerved vengeance will be farre more terrible and intollerable. But what meane I thus by too late repentance and lamentation to ſeeke to prolong time? my laſt houre is come, I heare the heart-ſtrings breake, this filthy houſe of clay ready to fall on my head; here is neither hope, helpe, nor place of any longer abiding:<note place="margin">The ſeparation of the ſoule from the body.</note> and muſt I needs bee gone? thou filthy carcaſe, with fare ill, farre well, I leave thee.

And thus the Godleſſe and unregenerated worldling, who made earth his paradiſe, his belly his god, and his luſt his law; as in his life hee ſowed vanity, ſo now hee is dead and reapeth miſery: in his proſperity hee neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to ſerve God, now in his adverſity God refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to ſave him; and the divell, whom he long ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, now at length payes him his wages: deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was his life, damnable his death; the divell hath his ſoule, the grave hath his carcaſe.

And not as an object of comfort, to ſee it and rejoyce, but to the increaſing of their miſery, that they may ſee it and grieve the more;<note place="margin">Mat. 13.42.</note> there ſhall be weeping for griefe, and gnaſhing of teeth for madneſſe; they ſhall be by the worme of conſcience tormented in the fleſh; every fin there ſhall have its proper torment: for if in this life, by Gods permiſſion, the divell doth ſo grievouſly afflict the Saints, how muchmore grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly ſhall hee then afflict and torment the damned which are given up to his power for ever? There thy laſcivious eyes ſhall be afflicted with the fight of gaſtly ſpirits, thy curious eares ſhall be affrighted with hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous noiſe of howling divels, and gnaſhing teeth of damned Reprobates; thy dainty noſe ſhall be cloyed
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:20262:77"/> with the noyſome ſtench of ſulphur: thy delicate taſte, ſhall be pained with intollerable hunger: thy drunken throat, ſhall be parched with unquenchable thirſt: thy mind ſhall be tormented, to thinke how for the love of abortive pleaſures, which periſhed ere they budded; that thou ſo fooliſhly loſt heavens joyes, and incurred helliſh paines, which laſt beyond eternity: how ſhall the underſtanding be racked, to conſider, how for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany riches, thou haſt loſt the eternall treaſure, and changed heavens felicity, for hels miſery: where every part of the body without any intermiſſion of paine, ſhall be alike tormented continually. In theſe helliſh torments? thou ſhalt be deprived of the beatificall ſight of God; wherein conſiſts the ſoveraigne good,<note place="margin">Math. 25, 10.</note> and life of the ſoule: for when the Virgins that are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red are entred in with the Bridegroom, the gate ſhal be preſently ſhut againſt the reprobate and damned; that is, the gate of indulgence, the gate of mercy, the gate of conſolation, the gate of hope, and the gate of holy converſation: the damned ſhall hate all the creatures of God, they ſhall hate one another, they ſhall hate the holy Angels, and the Elect of God, and even God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; but not properly in his owne nature, but in the effects of his juſtice. All the evils preſent in this life are ſingle and by degrees; one is troubled with poverty, another is tormented with ſickneſſe, another is oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with grievous wrongs, another with hard ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, another over-burthened with calamities, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother contaminated with reproches; but there, all at once ſhall be tormented with all evils, the paines there ſhall be univerſall,<note place="margin">Every member for his ſinnes ſhall have his proper puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> in all the ſences &amp; members of both body and ſoule: in this life hope of releaſe mitigateth all troubles, but there is left no hope of deliverance, there is no hope of mitigation or eaſe, not ſo much as for one moment; but the puniſhment of hell is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: there ſhall be no order, but horror; no voice, but
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:20262:78"/> blaſphemers and houlers; no noiſe, but of tortures and of the tortured; no ſociety, but of the divel and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; who being tormented themſelves ſhall have no other eaſe, but to wreak their fury in tormenting their fellowes damned: there ſhall be puniſhment, without pity; miſery, without mercy; ſorrow, without ſuccour; crying, without comfort; miſchiefe, without meaſure; torment without eaſe; where the worme never dieth, nor the fire never quenched:<note place="margin">Mark. 9.44. Eſay 66.24.</note> in which flame thou ſhalt be ever burning, and never conſumed; ever dying, and never dead; ever rowing in the paines of death, &amp; never rid, nor knowing no end of thoſe pangs: So that after thou haſt endured them ſo many 1000 yeeres, as there is graſſe on the earth, or ſands on the ſea ſhore, thou art no neerer to have an end of thy torments, then thou waſt the firſt day that thou waſt caſt into them: yea, ſo farre are they from ending, that they are ever but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: but if after a thouſand times ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeeres, the damned ſoule could but conceive a hope that thoſe her torments ſhould have an end, this would be ſome comfort, to thinke that at length an end will come: but as oft as the mind thinketh of this word <hi>never,</hi> it is another hell, in the midſt of hell.</p>
                  <p>Therfore, O devout ſoul, think upon the eternity of hell torments, &amp; thou ſhalt the more truly underſtand the grievouſnes thereof.

Oh eternity, eternity, it is thou alone beyond all meaſure that doſt encreaſe the puniſhment of the damned: grievous is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the damned, for the cruelty of the paine; yet it is more grievous for the diverſity of the puniſhment;<note place="margin">Math. 21.13.</note>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:20262:78"/> but it is moſt grievous for the eternity of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: that life ſhall be mortiferous,<note place="margin">The damned ſhall ſeeke death and ſhall not finde it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had life and loſt it.</note> and that death ſhall be immortall: if it be life, why doth it kill? if it be death, why doth it alwaies endure? What eternity is, is not perfectly knowne; and it is no wonder: for what created mind can comprehend that, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meaſured by any time? but if thou wilt gueſſe what the ſpace of eternity is, think upon the time that was before the world was created; if thou canſt finde Gods beginning, then mayſt thou finde when the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of the damned ſhall have end, &amp; not before, hence ſhall ariſe their dolefull, wo and alaſſe, for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. Oh, Lord Jeſus, which by thy paſſion, haſt made ſatisfaction for our ſins, deliver us from eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>This is the ſecond death, the generall perfect ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all curſedneſſe and miſery, which every dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned reprobate muſt ſuffer ſo long as God and his Saints ſhall enjoy bliſſe and felicity in heaven for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre of the miſery of man in his ſtate of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, unleſſe he be renewed by grace in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>This is the portion, this is the ſtate of the evill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed wicked wiſe men of this world; and are here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verriſed of their greedy groping after the ſweet temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the divell; wherein ſuch doe rejoyce and take their pleaſure, till death comming ſuddenly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, then fall they into the horrible pit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate darkneſſe, due unto their ſinnes and wicked deſerts.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre I have proceeded in the firſt part of this tractate of the divine eſſence of God, and how hee is to be underſtood in his holy attributes: and of the ſtate, death, and miſery of man put for the whole paſſage of the old Teſtament, from the creation of man to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of the Son of God, which doth humble us

                  <p>The Story of the Bible, from the firſt beginning, to the birth of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, doth for the moſt part declare the miſerable condition of man-kind, how hee hath falne from the innocency of his nature, which God gave him in his firſt creation, and how he hath continued in ſin, and the curſe of God for ſin, having no power in himſelfe to ſatisfie the juſtice of God,<note place="margin">How to uſe and apply the Scriptures.</note> or to reconcile himſelfe to his favour; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did God give the Law of the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the particulars of his revealed Will, both to provoke men to endeavour in the exerciſe of all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and alſo that by the knowledge of the Law, men might know their owne defects of nature, and the frailneſſe thereof, and by their humiliation might be prepared and made fit for the mercy of the Goſpell: for though Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15. &amp; 12 3. Rom. 1.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> the ſubſtance of the Goſpell, was in the counſell of God from all beginnings, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be the Redeemer of man-kinde, being alſo promiſed to our firſt Parents, and by whom all the faithfull before his incarnation, had the pardon of their ſins, apprehending by faith, the promiſe of his righteouſneſſe, yet was not this grace declared unto them in ſuch plaine and direct evidence, as now it is to us in the preaching of the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Hebr. 9.</note> it being then delivered onely in Shadowes, Ceremonies, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, and in the myſticall ſenſe of Allegories, ſo that few had capacity and grace, rightly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, all which difficulties are now vaniſhed in the preaching of the Goſpell; the Goſpell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting us in moſt familiar and eaſie demonſtrations, the Subſtance without the Shadowes, and the Truth
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:20262:81"/> without the Figure, withall, giving directions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible rules, not onely to know the meanes of our ſalvation, but how to make it ours, to apprehend and apply it to our owne particular comfort,<note place="margin">The great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Goſpel.</note> and this grace doth the Goſpell give with ſuch favour, as that the neceſſary doctrines exceed not the underſtanding, of men of meaneſt capacities, but that all that will, without reſpect or exception, may reach their hands of faith to the croſſe of Chriſt, and freely apprehend the meanes of their ſalvation, which is the Lord Jeſus, triumphing at the conqueſt of his death, over ſin, hell and damnation.</p>
                  <p>This is a bleſſed alteration in the ſtate of the world; for in the time,<note place="margin">A happy alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> when the grace of the Goſpell was hid in the clouds of the Ceremonies, the obſervers of the ceremoniall Law, did ſeldome underſtand the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſenſe of the Ceremony, which did alwaies allude to ſome particular grace in the Goſpell. Therefore,<note place="margin">The ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Law did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to the grace of the Goſpel.</note> though God was pleaſed to accept of their carefull endeavours in the religious obſerving the Ceremony, which indeed was but a Figure of the Truth included in the Ceremony, yet they wanted a great part of that ſpirituall comfort, which wee have in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Covenant of grace, the Goſpell, the grace of God appearing to them,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.11, &amp;c.</note> as God himſelfe did to the Iſraelites their fathers, at the delivering of the Law in clouds, in fire, in ſmoke and thunders,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.16.</note> but to us he doth appeare more familiarly by Jeſus Chriſt his Sonne, the moſt lively repreſentment of himſelfe, aſſuming our nature; and converſing with us, did wound our ſin, and healed the wounds ſin had made in our ſoules; whoſe words taught ſalvation; whoſe actions wrought it. This is the difference betwixt the Law and the Goſpel;<note place="margin">What the Law commandeth, and what the Goſpel.</note> the Law commandeth to doe and live, if not, to die; the Goſpell all mercy, requireth to believe onely, and live; and this is a wonderfull degree of Gods favour, that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:20262:82"/> becauſe wee are not able to keepe the covenants of the Law, is pleaſed therefore to yeeld to our infirmities, to alter our obligation, and enter new covenant with us; the covenant of grace,<note place="margin">The wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full love of God towards us.</note> whereby God doth indent with man, and binds the juſtice of the Law, in the bonds of his mercy, promiſing ſalvation to all them that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully believe in the merits and mediation of his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt. Thus doth God allure us by eaſie meanes and faire promiſes to everlaſting life, which the Law denieth to all men; no man being able to ſatisfie the juſtice of the Law. If it be objected then that the grace of the Goſpell doth deſtroy the workes of the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that mercy is given of grace, and not of deſert: it is anſwered, that the Goſpell doth not deſtroy the workes of the Law, and the ſubſtance thereof; but onely doth mitigate the rigour and ſeverity thereof. As God when he preſerved <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lyons denne, hee did not deſtroy the Lyons, but onely ſhut their mouthes, and bound their power, that they might not hurt <hi>Daniel:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 6.16.</note> ſo he did not deſtroy the Law, but onely reſtraine the violence thereof from hurting his <hi>Daniels;</hi> that is, his faithfull ſervants: and as when King <hi>Darius</hi> tooke <hi>Daniel</hi> from the denne, and caſt in his accuſers, the Lyons power was no longer ſhut up,<note place="margin">Dan. 6.24.</note> but had the maſtery and devoured them, their wives, and children; no more ſhall the reprobates avoyd the condemnation of the Law, notwithſtanding the promiſe of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and the new covenant of grace. Becauſe no man hath the benefit of mercy, but hee that firſt is the child of faith; therefore the great King of all the world ſhall take his faithfull <hi>Daniels</hi> his Elect, from the power of the Lyons, the Law, but leaveth the reprobate in the ſtate of their deſtruction. Thus much in generall of the Goſpell, and the difference betweene that and the Law, and them that lived under the bondage of the Law, and us that now live in the liberty of the Goſpell: the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:20262:82"/> purpoſe of the Goſpell, is the ſalvation of man.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the Angell that was the firſt preacher of the goſpell, told the ſhepheards, that hee brought them tydings of great joy:<note place="margin">Luk. 2.10.</note> indeed a greater could not be, then to bring them tydings of their ſalvation. The matter of the goſpell is the life, the death, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Jeſus Chriſt: for they are the onely meanes by which wee attaine to the favour of ſalvation:<note place="margin">Eſay 43.11.</note> his doctrines were directions, his life examples, and his death was, and is life eternall, to all them that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him by a lively faith. In the circumſtance of the goſpell is principally conſidered: Firſt, God who of himſelfe, and of his owne election, without any cauſe in man, did enter this covenant of grace; being moved onely by the pleaſure of his owne moſt holy will, and by his owne gracious love to his creatures: for ſo ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>God ſo loved the world,</hi>

In every word there is a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of love, infinitely beyond all compariſon, wherein it ſeemeth that God doth, as it were, put off his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and deſcend himſelfe in his care to pity; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe the ruined ſtate of ſinfull man, his enemie.

It is therefore moſt wonderfull in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, that hee being Lord of all the world, that he would leave the boſome of his Father, and for a time to put off the preſence of his divine Majeſty, and to take our nature upon him in humility,<note place="margin">Strong witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the love of Chriſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us.</note> and in a baſe eſtate: to undertake not onely to ſatisfie the Law, and to make good our defects; but alſo to beare the diſpleaſure of his Father, and to ſuffer the malice of wicked men to prevaile againſt him, even to his death: and that he hath endured all this for the ſinnes and good of man; a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that by ſinne had brought himſelfe in diſgrace and heavy diſpleaſure with God: and which is moſt of all, that hee hath done all this by his owne appointment, without either command or direction, there being no power above him by whom he could bee commanded. This incomparable love of God, is able to aſtoniſh a Chriſtian meditation, and to make a man admire, and ſay with holy <hi>David: Lord, what is man that thou haſt ſuch reſpect unto him,</hi>

Theſe conſiderations are moſt weighty in the generall underſtanding of the Goſpel, to which is added this admonition, that it behoves every man carefully to eſteeme worthily and reverently of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe God doth judge the contemners thereof to be guilty of the deſerved and eternall damnation;<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.10, 11, 12.</note> and that if God preſent them the meanes to communicate with the benefit of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that they then neglect rather all the profits in the world, then the rich treaſure of the Goſpel; for it is that one thing, that is onely neceſſary and availeable to ſalvation, and that pearle of price, for which wee are adviſed to ſell all that wee have to purchaſe it; for he that hath that precious Jewell,<note place="margin">Mat. 45.46.</note> hath ſufficient wealth, and hee that hath all things but that, hath nothing, if hee hath not that: for if one man had that all men have, he nothing had, unleſſe he alſo had a ſoule; alas, <hi>what will it advantage a man, to win the whole world, and loſe his owne ſoule?</hi> and what enlargement can he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that hath the hidden treaſure of the Goſpel in his heart, whereby hee hath continuall comfort, and

                  <p>This doth generally remember all men the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable degree of Gods favour to man-kind, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our apoſtacy from the favour and ſervice of God, and our continuall trade of ſinning, which might incenſe the juſtice of God, to deſtroy us at once, and for ever, yet doth he continue himſelfe in his owne kind a loving God, and a father compaſſionate,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.9.

Secondly, it doth admoniſh all men careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to apprehend the grace of the Goſpell, and not to neglect the preſent, and the pretious opportunity, that God hath given them, becauſe he that ſhall breake this Covenant of grace, ſhall doubtleſſe forfeit the eſtate both of body and ſoule unto eternall damnation; for this Covenant of the Goſpel, as it is the greateſt of all the favours of God, ſo it is the laſt, and that being neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, there is no other to be hoped for. Thirdly, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpell doth not deſtroy the ſubſtance of the Law, but onely mitigateth and ſweetens the ſeverity thereof, by a gracious diſpenſation from the extremity of juſtice; it behoveth all men to be equally as carefull in the performance of the duties of the Law, as if there were no other Covenant but the Law to judge them:<note place="margin">The Law makes us fit for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.

Sixthly, ſeeing the officers appointed and choſen by Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe for the miniſtration of the Goſpel, were the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and after them the godly and reverend Martyrs in the primitive Church, by whoſe diligence the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſpred it ſelfe over all the knowne world; this doth admoniſh all them that either are Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, or that have power to make them, what choice and care is to be had of their uprightneſſe and godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and what diligence is required of their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall travells; all which ought to faſhion themſelves as neere as they can, to the example of the holy Apoſtles.

Let the Prophets and Apoſtles be our Counſellors, their hands will not be corrupted, their judgement cannot erre: let us therefore affy in their confidence, and endeavour as they direct us.

Secondly, ſeeing the Sonne of God was content for our ſakes to undergoe ſo great a travell, and for our ſakes to unite our farre unequall and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy nature to his divinity; wee ought for his ſake to refuſe no travell that may advance his honour, or expreſſe our thankefulneſſe for his infinite favours done for us, and by whoſe onely meanes our ſoules have deliverance from eternall captivity and torment.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, ſeeing the whole matter of the Covenant of grace is fully contained in the words and workes of Jeſus Chriſt, and that all things neceſſary, both to a civill and Chriſtian life, are contained in the Story of the holy Goſpell, it behoveth all men to give that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:20262:97"/> ſacred Word preheminence, and that no man,<note place="margin">All directions muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to Scripture.</note> neither any ſtate or fellowſhip of men whatſoever, preſume to decree or ordaine Canons, or Statutes Eccleſiaſticall or civill, which is any way repugnant, or may prejudice the directions of Jeſus Chriſt, delivered and ſet forth, in the moſt holy Goſpell; but as Chriſt our Prince, our Prieſt, and our Prophet, hath given us, either by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or example;<note place="margin">Eccle. 18.

Therefore by the ſquare of the Scriptures all men ought to meaſure the Lawfulneſſe of every action, and direction, and that whatſoever ſhall diſagree from God, and the holy Scriptures, may be judged error and intruſion of diſorder; and therefore of neceſſity to be ſpewed out of every Church and State of Chriſtian men.</p>
                  <p>The meditation of this doctrine, and theſe duties, ſhould make us ſerious in our Chriſtian care: let us not now content our ſelves to have onely a generall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt Jeſus our Redeemer,<note place="margin">To conſider God in his Majeſty onely is terrible.</note> but let us labour to underſtand him in his double nature; for if we conſider him in his divinity, as he is God onely, it is a terrour to our remembrance: but if we conſider him in his double nature, it gives us hope and alacrity; for the Majeſty of God is terrible to ſinfull man, but his mercy is
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:20262:98"/> comfortable, and ſupporteth the falling ſpirits of our ſoules, which would faint and die in deſpaire, if the grace of God did not ſuccour and give ſupply to ſuch extremities: therefore as God doth moſt delight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the uſe of his mercy, ſo let us delight our ſoules moſt in the holy contemplation of his mercy; and as Chriſt Jeſus is the moſt lively character of his mercy,<note place="margin">Chriſt Ieſus is the character of Gods mercy.</note> ſo let our cares bee moſt buſie in the meditations of Chriſt: his Goſpell is the booke of Gods mercies, wee have eyes of faith, and can both ſee and read the ſtories of mercy; let us therefore direct our labours and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour our ſtudies in the moſt happy knowledge of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and in him wee ſhall finde all goodneſſe, and infinite variety of matter: in him wee ſhall finde the cauſe of our redemption;<note place="margin">Where to finde the cauſe of mans redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> wee ſhall finde it in his will: wee ſhall finde it in his working: he did cauſe our good, he did effect it alſo; in his will was the cauſe, in his workes was the effect. This godly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation may kindle a zeale in them that were dead in ſinne, and provoke holineſſe where it is not; to ſee the infinite greatneſſe,<note place="margin">Ier. 4.2.

This is proved in the examples of all men, that have had the grace of true and unfeyned repentance: every penitent child of grace having ſorrow and affliction in his ſoule, becauſe of his ſinne by which hee hath provoked his God and his Creator againſt him. Thus did <hi>Iob,</hi> and thus did <hi>David</hi> repent them: and ſo doe, and will doe, all that would profit by their repentance.<note place="margin">Iob 42.6. 2 Sam. 12 13.</note> And here is neceſſarily to bee conſidered and obſerved, that though our repentance have reſpect to the benefits of our owne eſtate as being a moſt neceſſary ſervice in our ſalvation, yet the maine reſpect we ought to have to God, whoſe
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:20262:102"/> glory we muſt preferre,<note place="margin">God muſt be reſpected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our ſoules</note> even before the ſalvation of our ſoules; making him the principall, and our ſelves but ſecondary reſpects of our repentance. And herein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth the difference betweene true and falſe repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: for the falſe and Godleſſe repentance ſorroweth for their ſinne, onely becauſe God doth puniſh and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict them for their ſinne;<note place="margin">Exod. 9.27. 1 Sam. 15.24, 25 King. 21.27. Math. 27.3, 4.</note> and therefore their ſorrow is chiefly for the puniſhment, and but reſpectively for their ſinne. Thus did <hi>Pharaoh, Saul, Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> repent them; and ſo doe all falſe and feyned repenters, that feare God for their owne reſpects, and not themſelves for God.<note place="margin">Note.</note> A true and godly repentance ſorroweth for ſinne, becauſe it is ſinne, and not becauſe it deſerveth puniſhment: and here the maine reſpect is to be had to God, and to our ſelves onely for Gods ſake: for though the feare and dread of puniſhment be ſufficient to move any mans repentance, yet wee muſt not make that the cauſe of our ſpirituall ſorrow, but much rather becauſe we have offended ſo gracious a God, who hath declared himſelfe to us in ſo many and great demonſtrations of his love to mankind: this ought to be more ſenſible to our wounded ſoules then the horror wee have of our condemnation: thus are holy men moved in their griefe and paſſion of their repentance: the maine difference then betweene true and falſe repentance is this:<note place="margin">Note.</note> true repentance is cauſed by reverence wee have of the love of God; falſe repentance by the feare we have of Gods juſtice, and the puniſhment due to our ſinnes: the one is the office of a ſonne; the other is the office of a ſlave: both of them repenting one matter, but for divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. Sinne then is the materiall cauſe of repentance; the moving cauſe is God, who moving by his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the hearts of his Elect, preſents them the ugly formes of their ſinnes;<note place="margin">God is the moving cauſe in every office of grace.</note> awakes their conſciences, and ſtirres them to a ſerious cogitation of their ſinnes, and wretchedneſſe; giving them ſtill ſuch proportion of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:20262:102"/> grace as the degrees of their repentance and ſpirituall ſorrow ſhall require, and that God is the firſt moving cauſe to godly repentance is evident by many places of Scripture: namely, the ſecond of <hi>Timothy,</hi> where Saint <hi>Paul</hi> adviſing <hi>Timothy</hi> to inſtruct them that are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry minded, he giveth this reaſon,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. Verſ. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>Becauſe ye ſhall thereby prove if God at any time will give them repentance, that they may know the truth.</hi> Here repentance is called the gift of God, which doth utterly barre man from all cauſe of boaſting his owne ability in this neceſſary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.8.9.</note> 
                     <hi>You are ſaved by grace through faith,</hi> and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God, <hi>not of workes, leaſt any man ſhould boaſt himſelfe.</hi> Alſo in the Acts of the Apoſtles, proving Jeſus to bee Chriſt, and God, coequall to his Father;<note place="margin">Acts 5.31.</note> uſeth this argument before the counſell of the Jewes: that God made him a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and forgiveneſſe of ſins: where the power of forgiving of ſins, and giving repentance, is made a proofe of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, interpoſed betweene his office of Saviour and his power of forgiving of ſins.

                  <p>Now of the cure or meanes of deliverance from ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall griefe. In the curing is conſidered: firſt, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring and dreſſing of the wounded ſoule, whereby it is made fit for curing. Secondly, the matter to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the ſoule. Thirdly, the manner of applyment. In the preparing of the wounded ſoule, there be foure things neceſſary: Firſt, a ſpirituall ſorrow for ſinne; that is aſcent of ſorrow in the ſoule, cauſed by a cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſin and guiltineſſe, and this is a neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative in a repentant ſoule: for that ſoule cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a ſpirituall refreſhment, that hath not firſt a ſenſe of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:20262:103"/> ſorrow, and feeling of preſent calamity. This prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative to repentance was in the Jewes that were hearers of holy <hi>Peter,</hi> when he declared before them their ſinne in crucifying the Lord Jeſus;<note place="margin">Acts 2.37.</note> for the text ſaith, <hi>When they heard it, they were pricked in their hearts, and ſaid, what ſhall we doe?</hi> as if the preſent ſorrow and anguiſh did ſo aſtoniſh them, as they knew not what to doe, nor how to adviſe themſelves.<note place="margin">Humble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> The next preparative, is an humble acknowledgement of the ſoule, of the miſery it is in, and an expoſing of ſuch particular griefes as we finde in the regiſter of our conſcience: this is alſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in the preparing of our ſoules. For though God, the Phyſition of our ſicke ſoules, underſtand our ſinnes better then our ſelves, and can remember them better then conſcience; yet it is great reaſon, that hee which deſireth the health of his ſoule, ſhould declare ſo much of his griefe as hee can remember; not to inſtruct or helpe the knowledge of God, but to confeſſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our ſelues, and our dutifull deſires. This acknowledgement of ſinne was common in the cuſtome of holy <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The example of holy David. Pſal. 32.5, 6.</note> how often hath hee confeſſed his ſinne and expoſed his griefe before God? for God is ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of our good, as that then he readily helpeth us, when we doe but carefully deſire it. Therefore ſaith the Prophet <hi>David, I ſaid I would confeſſe my ſinne unto the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſ 6.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſo thou forgaveſt the wickedneſſe thereof. David</hi> did but ſay he would confeſſe his ſinne; God taketh his word, and forgave him his ſinnes: and certainely hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unfeyned acknowledgement in our repentance, is an undoubted teſtimony that God doth give us grace, and that he will without queſtion give us his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. The third preparative conſiſteth in holy action, that is,<note place="margin">No man can ſatisfie Gods juſtice for ſin.</note> when we endeavour a reformation, and declare our repentance in a conſcionable diſcharge of our duty: for though no man can ſatisfie the juſtice of God for ſinne, yet ought all men ſo much as they have by the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:20262:103"/> power of grace given them to ſatisfie men: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, he that ſtealeth or defraudeth, be it by force, or of fraud, is of neceſſitie bound to make reſtitution, if he be able. And this the reformed Publican <hi>Zacheus</hi> well underſtood, who profeſſing before Chriſt his reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and repentance, to witneſſe it to be true and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, hee gave this infallible token: <hi>Behold Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 19.8 9.</note> ſaith he, <hi>the halfe of my goods I give to the poore, and if I have taken from any man by force, or forged cavillation, I reſtore him foure-fold,</hi> and the Text ſaith in the next Verſe, that then ſalvation was come into his houſe, and ſo <hi>Zacheus</hi> endevouring that hee could not, did at one time entertaine both his Saviour and his ſalvation; therefore, though no man can ſatisfie the Law, yet every man muſt endeavovr it: otherwiſe his repentance is idle and but vaine, neither can hee have part in the righteouſneſſe and redemption of Jeſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Pſa. 25.1, 2, &amp;c.</note> The laſt preparative is prayer, that is, a lifting up of the heart to God with faith unfeigned, and hopefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence; in the exerciſe of prayer, there is a double office: Firſt, wee muſt expoſe our griefe; next, we muſt implore his favour: for as in ordinary cures in ſurgery,<note place="margin">Note.</note> the patient muſt firſt ſuffer his wounds to be ript, launſt and ſearch'd, before the remedy can be applyed to the ſore; ſo muſt wee rip and ſearch the wounds of our ſoule, avoid and empty the infectious matter, and when we have it out,<note place="margin">2 King 19.14, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To declare the manner and the cauſes of godleſſe ſorrow, and falſe repentance, wee will avoid them; for their number and variety, let the true judge the falſe; and let this true forme of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance here preſcribed, teach the Chriſtian Reader, to avoid all diſſimulation and hypocritical ſorrow for ſin,<note place="margin">Hypocriticall ſorrow is in God hatred. 2 Cor. 7.10, 11.</note> and remember that godly ſorrow cauſeth repentance, not to be repented of, but worldly ſorrow cauſeth death.

                  <p>This Doctrine of Repentance and ſpirituall ſorrow, doth remember all men very needfull admoniſhments. Firſt, ſeeing that ſin is the cauſe for which we repent us, and by whoſe poyſon our ſoules are ſo grievouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and ſo fouly deformed and wounded; it ought to move all men to a loathing and deteſtation of ſin, by which we are grieved in our ſelves, and brought in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and diſpleaſure of Almighty God;<note place="margin">Note.</note> for if wee ſo carefully avoid all ſuch annoyances as bring any little taſte of griefe to our bodies in this temporall life, wee ought much more to avoyd ſin, which cauſeth ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of griefe in our ſoules, and doth both deprive us of Gods favour, and bringeth an everlaſting deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon us. Secondly, ſeeing there is no repentance
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:20262:105"/> profitable to ſalvation, but that which is cauſed in us by the moving of Gods holy Spirit; it behoveth all men to be ſerious in their repentance, and not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with a ſlender examination of their ſins, and then returne againe to their former remiſſeneſſe and diſobedience, but to be heedfully carefull to repent them of all ſinne, and to be conſtant in that care, without alteration, without interruption; and that our repentance reſpect rather a ſhame and griefe, to have offended ſo gracious a God, then any feare of temporall or eternall puniſhment,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ahabs</hi> repentance.</note> leſt, as did <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> by ſuch falſe and feigned repentance, they loſe their ſoules. Thirdly, ſeeing the ſoule cannot be cured but by repentance, neither can apply or apprehend Chriſt Jeſus, unleſſe it be firſt prepared and made fit by the exerciſe of theſe duties, and not to ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the exerciſe of one or two of them; but to endevour them all, becauſe they are all neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: for as in the Commandements of the Law, he that faileth in one breaketh all; ſo in theſe duties of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, he that neglecteth one,<note place="margin">The danger of preſumption.</note> profiteth by none, but annihilateth the purpoſe of his ſpirituall ſorrow. Let no man therefore flatter himſelfe with this preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if hee hath beene an extortioner, a thiefe, or a godleſſe perſon, that his repentance will ſuffice, though hee be ſorry for his ſins, and acknowledge them to God; though theſe be very needfull and neceſſary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet they are not all the duties of our ſoule in our preparation to repentance; therefore if hee hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted,<note place="margin">Luk. 19.8.</note> or as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, taken by forged cavillation from any man, that is, by indirect or diſhoneſt courſe or meanes,<note place="margin">Verſe 9.</note> hee muſt repent as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, and make reſtitution, as farre as he can, otherwiſe ſalvation can never come to his houſe; therefore, as they are all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, ſo are they all joyntly neceſſary, every man being bound to all theſe, as God and grace ſhall enable
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:20262:105"/> him. Fourthly, ſeeing Chriſt Jeſus is that Phyſician, and that onely ſalve which is able to cure a wounded ſoule; and that without him there is no working, no cauſe, no meanes of ſpirituall deliverance from ſinne,<note place="margin">We muſt ſell all to purchaſe Chriſt.</note> and griefe of a wounded conſcience. Therefore it moſt neerely concerneth all men to endeavour all meanes to purchaſe this Chriſt their ſalvation and righteouſneſſe, and to deſpiſe all things in reſpect of him their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and the onely ſoveraigne ſalve to heale their woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded conſcience.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing wee have Jeſus Chriſt propoſed us to be our ſalvation,<note place="margin">The willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Chriſt, to bee appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended of the faithfull.</note> who is alwaies willing and ready to bee apprehended and applyed to our ſoules, by whom wee onely enjoy the peace of conſcience, and the hope of Heaven: therefore no man ought to affy and have any confidence in the pardons of Popes, diſpenſations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, and ſuch traſh and merchandiſe; whereby the beſotted and blinded people of this world is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully delighted: for ſuch dangerous pedling ſtuffe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> muſt not bee thought to have equall vertue with the blood of Chriſt, or that they have any power in the cure of ſoules: but on the contrary, they ſurfeit the conſcience, and poyſon the ſoules of them that truſt in them; inlarging the wounds both in number and griefe,<note place="margin">Dangerous Phyſicke.</note> and maketh the ſoule incapable of cure, and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to have the precious blood of Chriſt Jeſus applyed unto it. Laſtly, ſeeing there is no meanes to apprehend and apply this Chriſt, the phyſicke and Phyſitian of our ſoules, but onely by a true and lively juſtifying faith:<note place="margin">Chriſt cannot be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but by a true faith only.</note> therefore it moſt neceſſarily concerneth all men, to have this meanes of apprehending Chriſt; becauſe, as it is ſaid, The ſalve, though moſt ſoveraine, cannot profit the ſore, unleſſe it bee applyed by faith, that being the maine act of our ſpirituall health: all other offices and duties, being but circumſtances to aſſiſt and forward this act. Moreover the faith by which wee apprehend
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:20262:106"/> Chriſt, muſt be more then a generall faith, for it profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not to our health and ſalvation, to know onely that Jeſus Chriſt is the preſent cure of our ſoules; unleſſe we alſo by a confident and a lively faith apprehend, and apply him to the ſore of our ſoules. Againe, ſeeing Chriſt is our only ſalvation, and ſeeing faith is the only meanes of apprehending him; we ought not to ſeeke or appoint any other meanes or matter of ſalvation; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any other manner of applying it: and therefore no man ought to aſcribe righteouſneſſe to himſelfe or his workes, or to the ſupererogating workes of his friends, but onely to Jeſus Chriſt: and that this Chriſt is onely apprehended by a ſaving faith: for by faith we live,<note place="margin">Note.</note> by faith we walke, by faith wee are juſtified, and our hearts purified; by it we vanquiſh the world; and without it it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore often meditate this doctrine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: what feare, what care, what affliction is in the ſoule at ſuch occaſion? let us practiſe it in our ſelves, and pity it in others: let us condemne ſinne to bee the greateſt cauſe of ſuch miſery; and let us condemne our ſelves to be the greateſt cauſe of that ſinne. When wee exerciſe this ſpirituall office of repentance, let us bee carefully buſie in the duties thereof;<note place="margin">A neceſſary reſolution.</note> let us ſearch the wounds of our ſoules, expell and empty the rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and putrefaction thereof: ſearch and dreſſe them, ſearch them by a ſerious examination of our ſins; and dreſſe them by an humble and hearty acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:<note place="margin">How to dreſſe the wounds of our ſoules.</note> let us alſo examine the actions and particulars of our lives; let us compare them with our duties, and thoſe that proportion not thereto, let us call them our errors and our ſinnes, and the wounds of our ſoules: let us by meanes of faith and prayer, referre our defects to bee ſupplyed to the moſt abſolute ſatisfactory righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt:<note place="margin">The righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt muſt ſupply all our defects.</note> what we finde ſin let us call it ſin; let us not flatter our errors, nor

Shun all ſuch ſin as the plague or leproſie, becauſe we know that ſalvation will not come to the houſe that is ſo infected, but as of neceſſity all ſin muſt bee cured,<note place="margin">All ſinne of neceſſity muſt be cured.</note> otherwiſe there is no cure in our repentance: let us hate all ſin, without diſpenſation of any; otherwiſe we repent not, but flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our ſelves in preſumption, and vaine confidence: and becauſe nothing can apprehend and apply ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our ſoules, but onely by the hands of ſaving faith: let us therefore bee ſure that our faith bee lively and ſtedfaſt faith; let us trie it by the evidence of our workes, they will beare us witneſſe and teſtifie what it is, and of what nature:<note place="margin">Workes muſt try our faith.</note> for as our faith in Chriſt doth juſtifie us before God; ſo the workes of our faith doe juſtifie us in the ſight of men. If the fruit of our faith be good, our faith it ſelfe then muſt needs be good, and availeable to apprehend and apply Jeſus Chriſt our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Let us therefore be plentifull in the exerciſe of good actions, that our conſcience may teſtifie our faith, and that our faith may bee able to execute the holy office aſſigned it:<note place="margin">We muſt be plentifull in good workes, and why.</note> when wee have the aſſurance of this faith, let us then with ſtedfaſt confidence looke up to Heaven; let us ſeeke him whom our ſoule loveth, and when we have found him, let us expoſe before him the calamity of our ſoules, and our preſent condition wee are in: let us lay open our ſins, diſcover our wounds,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:20262:107"/> declare our endeavour, and report our faith: when we have thus done, wee may aſſure our ſelves that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour will rejoyce at our recovery, be glad of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and returne, and will ſhew us his righteouſneſſe, and will alſo willingly yeeld himſelfe unto our faith, and give us free liberty in the uſe of his righteouſneſſe.<note place="margin">Apprehenſion of Chriſt.</note> Let us buſily apply our cares to apprehend him in his righteouſneſſe, and ſtretch our hands of faith, to the altar of his Croſſe, and with a wonderfull degree of comfort apply his ſufferings, his wounds, and his death, to heale the wounds which ſin hath made in our ſoules,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and infuſe his moſt precious blood into them, and with that blood ſhall enter the ſpirit of health, and everlaſting ſafety.

In reſpect of this new ſpirituall creation,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.17, 18. Rev. 21.1. Gal. 6.15. 1 Pet. 2.10. Epheſ. 4.24. Coloſ. 3.10. Matth. 26.28. 2 Pet. 3.13. Iſay. 66.12.13.

Neh. 13.19.</note> ſo in proceſſe of time, after our redemption, the firſt day wherein it was perfected, was dedicated to a holy reſt. The Jewes kept their Sabbath on the laſt day of the week, beginning it with the night, when God reſted from finiſhing the worke of his creation, but Chriſtians honour the Lord better, on the firſt day of the weeke, when the Lord aroſe. They kept their Sabbath in remembrance of the worlds creation, but Chriſtians celebrate it in memoriall of the worlds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;<note place="margin">Matth. 28, 1.

                  <p>Many godly Writers doe record many memorable things, which were done upon the firſt day of the weeke, as ſo many types that the chiefe worſhip of God ſhould under the new Teſtament be celebrated upon this day:<note place="margin">Exod. 31.</note> as that on this day the cloud of Gods Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty firſt ſate upon his people; <hi>Aaron</hi> and his children firſt executed their Prieſt-hood; God firſt ſolemnely bleſſed his people, the princes of his people firſt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red publikely unto God the firſt day, wherein fire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from heaven: the firſt of the world, of the

If this myſterie were ſo clearely ſeene by the Fathers and Prophets, under the ſhadowes of the old Teſtament;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.4.</note> ſurely the God of this world hath deepely blinded their mindes, who cannot ſee the truth thereof under the cleere ſhining light of the Goſpel.

                  <head>The properties of Charity, and true Love to our Chriſtian brethren.</head>
                  <p>CHriſt Jeſus our Saviour gave himſelfe for us, to redeeme us from all our ſinnes and wickedneſſe;<note place="margin">Titus 2.14.</note> and to purge us a peculiar people, followers of good workes. To this purpoſe wee are admoniſhed of the Lord, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good workes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 5.16, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>and glorifie your Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Therefore whilſt wee have time, let us doe good towards all men, and eſpecially towards them of the houſehold of faith. To this uſe the holy Scriptures were given unto us: for all Scripture inſpired from God,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16, 17</note> is profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct, to inſtruct in righteouſneſſe, that the man of God bee perfect and inſtructed to all good workes. It is cleare then, that we be not ſo juſtified by faith, that wee ſhould bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, barren, and unfruitfull of good workes, but rather that giving our ſelves continually unto good workes, wee ſhould advance the glory of Gods grace, and ſhew it before the eyes of all men, as the light of our new creation. for we are regenerated in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.23, 24.</note> and thereby wee doe declare our ſelves to bee juſtified before men. Therefore let us not onely ſhew our ſelves to be Chriſtians in name, but to become good of evill, and to declare that goodneſſe received of Chriſt by good workes; for they be as certaine fruits of our life, witneſſing the goodneſſe of our mind; and declaring the nature of our heavenly Father. Good workes bee the workes of faith, which worketh by love; they be the workes of God, which hee worketh in us, and by us, but it muſt be conſidered with what minde thoſe things be wrought which be of themſelves good, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the affection of love and mercy, or for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Such is his juſtice, that he loveth the ſame which is juſt and good, being himſelfe of all other moſt juſt, and the rewarder of all good workes that proceed of faith: but wee muſt not aſſume the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of our good workes to proceed of our owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, but unto the goodneſſe of God, who doth worke the effects of godlineſſe and charity in them that believe.</p>
                  <p>True and ſincere love is an inſeparable property in the godly: no Chriſtian without faith,<note place="margin">Iohn 15.17.12, 13, 14.</note> and no faith without charity: where there is not the brightneſſe of charity, neither is there the zeale of faith:<note place="margin">Note.</note> take away the light from the ſun, and thou maiſt aſwell take chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from faith.

Now the love of God is the ground of election, and Gods love is beſt knowne by his beſt gifts; the beſt things he reſerveth for thoſe he beſt loveth: as <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſent unto <hi>Benjamin</hi> more meſſes of meat,<note place="margin">Gen. 43.34.</note> and gave him richer gifts, and more coſtly apparell than to the reſt of his brethren:<note place="margin">Gen. 45.22.</note> So the Lord beſtoweth the beſt gifts upon the elect, his owne children.

Againe, ſeeing that in our mortification there is no reſpect of favour had to any ſinne, but that all ſinne muſt die, the ſinnes that have gained us either our profit or our pleaſure, for all ſinne being in hatred with God, all ſinne is therefore commanded to die, without diſpenſation, proviſo, or exception of any. It therefore behooveth all men to hate as God hateth, even all ſinne, becauſe all ſinne is in Gods hatred; leſt they provoke God as <hi>Saul</hi> did, and with <hi>Saul</hi> to declare themſelves reprobates. God commanded <hi>Saul</hi> to deſtroy the Amalekites,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.1. &amp;c.</note> a ſinfull and God-leſſe people; <hi>Saul</hi> performed his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement but in part, for though he deſtroyed many, yet he ſpared ſome; for which God caſt him from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and rent his Kingdome from him.

Theſe are they that our Saviour Chriſt calleth hypocrits,<note place="margin">Math. 23.</note> that point at little ſinnes in others, but flatter and foſter maine ones in themſelves: this evill cuſtome is farre ſhort of the duty of mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which requireth a loathing and deteſtation, nay a death, not of ſome ſinnes, not of other mens ſinnes,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:20262:138"/> but of our owne ſinnes, and of all our owne ſinnes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception of any: and ſeeing that the holy Ghoſt doth move this grace in our hearts, and doth give us ſpirituall power in the office of mortification. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth all men to addreſſe their prayers to God that he will give them the direction of his grace, to guide them in ſo needfull a performance, and that when they finde in themſelves a deſire to mortifie their ſinnes and ſinnefull affections;<note place="margin">Titus 1.12, &amp;c.</note> then let them aſſure themſelves that they are called by the divine and efficatious po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God to the performance of that duty, that then they yeeld their endeavour, with all diligence, to doe as the holy Ghoſt directs them, leſt by neglecting the admoniſhments of Gods Spirit, they bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a greater condemnation. The life and ſoule, as it were thereof, is the illumination and reformation of the minde and an efficatious bending, conforming and working of the heart and will, whereby it becomes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to the voyce of God, and returnes, as it were, an audible and lively eccho into their eares: the end thereof is firſt the glory of God, and the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his mercy; to whom wee muſt aſcribe both grace and nature; and of whom wee have received our ſoules and bodies, yea, and the very ſoule of our ſoules, which is his ſpirit. The ſecond end of this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is our deliverance and tranſlation out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, infidelity, ſenſuality and rebellion,<note place="margin">The ſoule of our ſoules is the Spirit of God. 2 Theſ. 2, 14.</note> unto ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall grace and glory: for wee are called out of darkneſſe into light, that we might walke in light, and no longer ſerve the Prince of darkneſſe: wee are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of the world unto God, to the end that wee ſhould relinquiſh the luſts of the fleſh, the pleaſures of the world, and to ſerve God in newneſſe of life, that walking uprightly before him in this world, we may live and raigne with him for ever in the world to come.</p>

                  <p>The manner of regeneration, is how the children of God bee borne a new, and how it is cauſed by the ſecret working of Gods holy Spirit in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of grace:<note place="margin">John 3.8.</note> he giveth an inſtance by the moving of the ayre: that is, when wee heare a whiſtling of the wind, we know it bloweth, yet doe we not know from whence it commeth; ſo in the act of regeneration, when we feele in our hearts the motion of Gods holy Spirit breathing ſalvation into our ſoules, and when our workes and conſciences give us an undoubted teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that we are regenerated and borne of God: it is then as vaine a care to ſearch into the ſecret working
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:20262:143"/> of the Spirit of God was to enquire of the mind, from whence it commeth or whether it goeth: this thing is not neceſſary, though regeneration is moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and not to be neglected upon paine of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>Seeing regeneration is of ſuch abſolute neceſſity to ſalvation,<note place="margin">Iohn 3.5.</note> that <hi>Except a man be regenerate, and borne anew of water and of the Spirit, hee cannot enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God:</hi> neither bee ſonnes, nay the ſervants of God, though we never ſo much endeavour in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of other Chriſtian duties. This doth admoniſh all men to have principall care to labour all meanes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to have faithfull and ſufficient witneſſes both from their conſciences, and by teſtimony of their workes, that they are the adopted children of God, eſtabliſhed in the aſſured hope of their ſalvation, being knowne and ſealed of God with the marke of regeneration: for it muſt needs bee ſufficient to reſolve a conſcience of Gods favour, when we know we are his children, it is a grounded cauſe to make us hopefull and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the truſt of Gods mercy. And ſeeing regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is an act of the holy Ghoſt, every man ought ſo to rectifie and reforme the errors of his life, as that the Spirit of God may not take loathing to enter our ſoules, but rather that by mortification and holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſe, wee may be prepared to entertaine that ſacred gueſt into our hearts, leaſt when hee commeth hee finde us, as God will finde the reprobate in the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unprovided, careleſſe, and ſecure; and ſo not ſeale us for his ſonnes, but marke us the children of death, and the friends of Antichriſt. Againe, ſeeing the regenerate are made the children of God, it ought therefore to be a principall care of every man to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, becauſe regeneration is the undoubted wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the child of God.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.10.</note> Wherefore Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth all men, to give diligence to make our

The ordinary outward meanes to bring us to holy and godly action,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.14.</note> is the preaching of the Goſpel; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>whereunto you are called by the Goſpel to the obtaining of the glory of the Lord Ieſus Christ.</hi> The Law ſerves to prepare our hearts for grace, but it is the oyly drops to the Goſpel, by the power of the Spirit, that doe ſoften and mollifie the heart, and makes it ſupple and pliable, and like Balme, it doth revive and comfort the heart and ſenſes, and makes them pliable to that which is good and godly:<note place="margin">Rom. 1.16.</note> the Goſpel is the power of God, that is, the inſtrument of Gods power unto ſalvation to all them that believe: alſo good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, afflictions, loſſes, croſſes, want, ſickneſſe, and the like, are by the bleſſing of God,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.23.</note> good preparatives to grace; but the preaching of the Goſpel is the proper inſtrument of the Spirit, for the effecting of grace: for by the word of the Goſpel, God ſpeakes to the eares of the ſoule, and by it, as by a pipe, hee conveyes his graces into the ciſternes of our hearts.</p>

The renovation of the will is when God gives a man grace truely to will good, as to believe, honour, feare, and obey God: the ſanctification of the memory, is an aptneſſe by grace, to keepe, and to bee mindfull of good things, eſpecially of the doctrine of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſuch like: the regeneration of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is when it is fitted to give true teſtimony to a mans heart of the remiſſion of his ſinnes, and of the carefulneſſe of his care to ſerve God, and to doe other good duties concerning our Chriſtian brethren; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts alſo in the ſpirituall transformation of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as joy, love, ſadneſſe, feare, anger, and ſuch like, whereby a man that is juſtified doth ſo temper them, by his reaſon refined, and by the light of the Law, with the helpe of the holy Spirit, that they do not break out, as in the wicked, that give the reines to their luſts, but are held in ſome good order; howbeit in this life, this is not done without much ſtrife and reluctation of the fleſh and Spirit, and is rather affected then effected. Here we muſt obſerve that ſanctification doth not alter the ſubſtance of man; but onely his corrupt and ſinfull qualities, it rectifieth affections, but aboliſheth them not; it corrects and moderates mirth, ſorrow, anger, and ſuch humane paſſions, but takes them not quite away; it tunes the jarring ſtrings of a mans heart, but breakes them not in peeces. As the fall of man did not
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:20262:146"/> aboliſh a mans eſſence, but corrupt his faculties; even ſo, the raiſing up and renovation of man doth not alter his very ſubſtance, but doth onely change his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted qualities and powers: this viſible reformation of a man is, when hee dedicates himſelfe unto God and good duties to his neighbours, whoſe ſinnes bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned which before raigned in his heart.

Now a man may aſſure himſelfe of faith, if hee love God for God himſelfe;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.5.</note> and his neighbour truely as himſelfe; for love accompanies faith, as the light doth the ſunne, indeed it proceeds from faith: for as one ſaith,<note place="margin">Gregory.</note> Such as is our faith, ſuch is our love; a man may aſſure himſelfe of a juſtifying faith, if he doe ſtrive againſt his doubtings, and with an honeſt heart doe will to believe and unfainedly deſire to bee recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto God, and withall doe uſe conſtantly the

But when our ſins are once nayled to the croſſe of Chriſt, and forgiven us,<note place="margin">Note.</note> then the winds are laid, the waves are ſettled, the ſea is calmed, the ſoule is quieted, and imparked within the pales of peace. Againe, wee may know that our peace is good, and that our juſtification is paſt with God; if wee ſhall find a promptitude and nimbleneſſe in our ſelves to doe that which is good: For when a man doth finde favour from God for the forgiveneſſe of his ſins, then the love of God conſtraineth him that joy which hee receiveth, and putteth new life into him,<note place="margin">Greenham.</note> and enforceth him to the performance of thoſe things which are pleaſing unto God; then his underſtanding is enlightened, his judgement is reformed, his affections are bettered, his joyes are in heaven, his deſires are to Chriſt-ward, his progreſſe to <hi>Canaan,</hi> his courſe to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and his anger is conſumed upon his owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions: For wee muſt know, that when God doth impute righteouſneſſe unto us, to prevent our damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

And becauſe all contention and ſtrife of words is in the hatred of my nature, I will as I finde it written downe ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliver my ſelfe in a large argument and ſtrike one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one blow at the enemy of faith, that I may bee knowne to be an enemy of that enemy; and that by a familiar proofe I may inſtruct the knowledge of them that are leſſe learned: For they that deny juſtification by fayth, and approve it by works would frame this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the teſtimony of Saint <hi>James,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 2.17. &amp;c.</note> who ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a generall faith, doth utterly diſable it from the office of juſtification: and therefore he ſaith, that <hi>Faith without workes, is dead in it ſelfe; for as the body without the ſpirit is dead, even ſo faith without workes is dead alſo.</hi> Therefore, ſay they, that the Apoſtle conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that of workes a man is juſtified, and not of faith onely. To this is anſwered, it is moſt true that fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe faith is dead, neyther can juſtifie, and that good workes are the ſpirit and ſoule of a living faith; for as the body without the ſoule, is not a living man but a dead carcaſe; ſo faith without workes is not living,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:20262:155"/> is not ſaving, nay, is not true faith, but onely beares a generall name: and with Saint <hi>Iames</hi> wee may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude againſt all ſuch faith. But if there be a faith that hath a neceſſity depending of good workes, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily as the ſoule to the body, and the fruit to the tree, and that this faith declare it ſelfe to bee plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in good actions, the fruits of a living faith; we may then with Saint <hi>James</hi> conclude againſt them: for hee doth not as they doe, diſinable all faith in the worke of juſtification, but onely that faith which is dead,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and without workes. So both opinions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a neceſſity of workes; the one as the cauſe of juſtification, and the other as an effect in them ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.</p>
                  <p>It were eaſie to be large in numbring authorities, and in reporting ſuch diſtinctions and ſhifts as the decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved uſe in ſupporting their erroneous opinions: they are but inventions, therefore without reſpect wee will paſſe them over,<note place="margin">Note.</note> but adviſe the Chriſtian Reader to beware of both extreames, and modeſtly and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately to underſtand the meanes of his juſtification, that his zeale carry him to no extremity, but to the vertuous meane onely, and not to aſcribe all to fayth, and nought to workes, but to give them both their neceſſary reſpects: for as wee are not juſtified but by fayth, ſo our fayth is not juſtified but by our workes: for if our works be not faythfull, &amp; our fayth working, we are not juſtified, neyther can be ſaved. For when it is ſaid, that fayth onely juſtifieth, it is meant and not denyed that charity is joyned with that fayth which juſtifieth, being inſeparably united unto it; but that onely fayth, and not charity is the meanes by which we embrace Jeſus Chriſt, our juſtification &amp; righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. As for example, the fire hath heate and light, which qualities cannot bee ſevered in that ſubject;<note place="margin">Note.</note> yet the fire burneth by heate only, and not by light: now if
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:20262:155"/> they will reaſon &amp; ſay, if the heate of the fire only burn,<note place="margin">Similitude.</note> then it burneth without the light of the fire, but that it cannot do: ſuch is their reaſon againſt juſtification only, becauſe it cannot be ſeparated from charity. Likewiſe, though the parts of mans body bee joyned together, and one is not without another in a perfect body, yet the eye onely ſees, and the eare onely heares, and every part hath his diſtinct office; and ſo hath faith and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

                  <p>Seeing that none can be ſaved but thoſe that are firſt juſtified, and ſeeing none can be juſtified, but they that have a true, living and a working faith. It behoveth all men to have a principall care to have the aſſurance of this faith, that ſo they may be ſure to be juſtified, that they may be ſure to be ſaved. And becauſe all men are naturally prone to deceive themſelves with flattery and favourable opinion of themſelves and their owne actions; becauſe Saint <hi>James,</hi> and ſo the Scripture,<note place="margin">James 2.</note> in many places, doth utterly diſ-inable an idle dead and a fruitleſſe faith, from the office of Juſtification: it therefore neerely concerneth all men, ſeriouſly, and without private reſpect to examine their faith, and compare their faith and their workes together, that their workes being good, thoſe workes may juſtifie their faith to be a living and a ſaving faith, and that they content not themſelves with a bare and common hiſtoricall faith, the which the Divell and the damned ſoules may have; but that their faith may be approved good; by the ſufficient teſtimony of their good works, without which their faith cannot be good: For as the tree is knowne by his fruit; and as it is impoſſible to gather grapes of thornes, or figs of thiſtles: even ſo is our faith judged by our workes; and ſo it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that good workes ſhould proceed from an evill faith; or that a good faith ſhould not produce good

This ought to provoke all men to an emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of godly exerciſe, to contend to exceed in holy actions, and to ſquare and faſhion all their workes by their faith,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and to make every act of theirs, a teſtimony that they are truly faithfull: For he that is not with us, is againſt us, and thoſe workes of ours that witneſſe not for us, will be witneſſes againſt us, and will condemne us in the ſight of all men, that our faith is not good, or not at all; and that therefore wee are not juſtified, neither can be ſaved. This may judge all thoſe actions of men, that diſproportion a good faith and a good conſcience: For though men flatter themſelves, and promiſe peace to their ſoules, and thinke to be juſtified and ſaved by a bare acknowledgment of God, and their common hiſtoricall faith; yet in a time, when they thinke not on't,<note place="margin">Note.</note> their ungodly workes will make warre upon their ſoules, and bring upon them a ſure and a ſudden deſtruction.

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:20262:157"/> righteous in his preſence; it doth remember all men the admirable degree of Gods favour, and the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full operation of faith: Firſt, Gods favour towards us, hee being pleaſed to forgive us our ſins and deſerts of condemnation, and to give and impute the moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute righteouſneſſe of his deare Sonne, Chriſt, to all men upon this eaſie condition of faith, that ſuch, who have a true faith to apprehend him, ſhall be accepted in his favour as ſonnes, and ſhall appeare in the preſence of God as equally righteous, as if themſelves had actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally performed righteouſneſſe in their owne particular perſons: Secondly,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1, &amp;c.</note> wee are taught the powerfull ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of true faith; that it is able to enter heaven, and to apprehend and apply Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe, to reconcile the favour of God unto us, and to ſatisfie his diſpleaſure, to waſh off the leproſie and ſpots of our ſins, and to put on us the garment of righteouſneſſe, even Jeſus Chriſt the Sonne of God, by whom, and through whom, wee are juſtified in the fight of God, and by whom alſo wee ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore carefully endeavour our ſelves in a conſtant exerciſe of all godly actions, not that we repoſe our juſtification in the vertue or merit of our owne workes, but that by the teſtimony of our good works we may approve our ſelves to be faithfull; and that our faith is more than a common or a generall hiſtoricall faith, even a living and a ſaving faith, which is, and muſt be the onely meanes of our apprehending Chriſt, who is the all-ſufficient and onely matter of our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and let this be the onely glory and pride of our well-doing, that this witneſſe of workes ſhall gaine us the reputation of Gods ſervants; and that Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full children here on earth ſhall eſteeme and repute us to be of their fellow-brethren, then which, let us never deſire a greater cauſe of boaſting; and this judgement of good men, muſt needs riſe from the teſtimony of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:20262:158"/> good workes, becauſe there is an inevitable neceſſity of conſequence, and neceſſary dependence betweene faith and workes, they being as inſeparable as the heat from the fire, and as neceſſarily depending as the body and the ſoule; let this provoke us to a zealous forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all godly actions, becauſe thereby we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the aſſurance of our juſtifying faith, and thereby ſatisfie the deſire of our owne ſoules, and that doubt which otherwiſe might juſtly be had of us in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of men: From this argument muſt needs follow this concluſion, that ſeeing we have the fruits of faith,<note place="margin">Note.</note> good works; therefore we have alſo the cauſe of workes, true faith; and that therefore this faith thus working, is a tree of Gods owne planting; this is that uſe, this is that comfort and conſolation which wee ſhall underſtand and find in the nature of our beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving workes; thus let us eſteeme them, and but thus; let us therefore avoid and aboliſh that dangerous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of meriting by workes, becauſe it is farre better to want honour, then to force it from God by violence; nay, let us rather diſgrace our ſelves, then to diſ-inable our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: for if righteouſneſſe be from our ſelves, it is not onely from him, and then would follow that abſurd and blaſphemous concluſion, that he is not the onely Saviour; neither hath perfected the worke of mans ſalvation; let us therefore doe all the good we can:<note place="margin">Note.</note> but let us repute our deeds, though never ſo good, to be the effect, and not the cauſe of goodneſſe in us; let us alſo confidently hold, that nothing is able to merit ſalvation, but onely the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt; let us therefore utterly diſclaime our ſelves and our owne power, which is nothing but weakneſſe, and wholly aſcribe all vertue, and all power to our Saviour Chriſt, for it is ſafer to give him honour, then to take it from him; and it will farre better become our Chriſtian modeſty to acknowledge our weakeneſſe
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:20262:158"/> and infirmities, then proudly to boaſt and advance our ſelves above our deſerts, and worthineſſe. If therefore God by the moving of his holy Spirit, doe incline our hearts unto godlineſſe, hee will alſo give us grace to continue in the ſame, and give us a deſire and power in godly exerciſe; which when it makes us grow plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull in the demonſtration of holineſſe, let us aſcribe the glory thereof unto God to whom it is due onely; and onely acknowledge our ſelves to be that inſtrument, whereby his holy hand of grace is pleaſed to work with to our ſalvation.</p>

Patience is a kind of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, when wee doe willingly and conſtantly ſuffer thoſe things that be hard, painfull, ſorrowfull, and to our loſſe; every ſuffering of adverſity is not ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to be termed patience; for there is no man in the world,<note place="margin">It is requiſite that a patient man do ſuſtain and ſuffer his adverſities willingly.</note> but hee ſuffereth many things that hee would not doe, if he could any waies withſtand it; yet they are not to be called patient men, neither are they called impatient, which do ſuffer adverſity, but doe ſuſtaine it with an evill will, and diſcontented minde; for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience when we doe unwillingly, ſtrivingly, and with

                  <p>Now will I call to remembrance ſome of thoſe holy Fathers, in which the godly perſon may, as it were, in a glaſſe, behold, and conſider the patience of the holy Saints, and appoint himſelfe ever to endeavour and follow the ſame.

And thus wee be moved and provoked unto true patience, both by the examples of our heavenly Father, and of Chriſt our Saviour, his onely begotten: by the following of whom wee ſhall declare our ſelves to bee the children of God. Let us therefore follow the bright ſhining vertue of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of his heavenly grace: ſuch a one was <hi>Noah,</hi> who living in the middeſt of the malice of the moſt wicked and corrupt world,<note place="margin">

Doſt thou thinke that God will accept a flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring tongue, a wicked eye, a vaine eare, a falſe hand, without the ſacrifice of thy heart? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If I give all that I have, and ſpeake with the tongues of men, and of Angels and have not love,</hi> that is, give not my heart,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.1, &amp;c.</note>

By whoſe meanes death is no death to them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life and advantage: by whom they have the doore opened to everlaſting ſalvation; for ſo ought all men to underſtand of death,<note place="margin">Note.</note> as the common Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of all fleſh: the world is the priſon wherein we are ſhut; death, when he openeth the doore, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from priſon, leadeth the parties delivered, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to liberty, or judgement: for ſo are all that die, tranſported from earth, either to heaven, which is their liberty, or to hell, the place of execution. Death then is that one key that openeth the double paſſage: the one to heaven, the other to hell: the one leadeth to ſalvation, the other to damnation.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſeeing that death is a repoſe, and reſt from earthly labours, it ought to ſweeten the ſorrowes of this life with hopefull confidence, alacrity, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall comfort; notwithſtanding moſt men doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the profeſſours of holineſſe, but baſe and abject people, and deride their ſimplicity in wicked world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly policies; making holineſſe a note of folly, and their owne audacious impudence, the onely marke

To theſe men let us frame our imitation; let us care for our lives as they cared; let us alſo care to die as they cared, in every work of our life, let us remember our end, and at our end let us remember our hope, and in our hope our God: while we live here, let us remember that wee are priſoners, and in the bondage of our fleſh; and when we die, we know that we ſhall have free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
